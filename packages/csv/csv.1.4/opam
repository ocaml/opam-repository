synopsis: "A pure OCaml library to read and write CSV files."
description: """
This is a pure OCaml library to read and write CSV files, including
all extensions used by Excel — e.g. quotes, newlines, 8 bit
characters in fields, \\"0 etc. A special representation of rows of CSV
files with a header is provided. The library comes with a handy
command line tool called csvtool for handling CSV files from shell
scripts."""
