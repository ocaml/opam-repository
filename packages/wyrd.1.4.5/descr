Text-based front-end to Remind, a sophisticated calendar and alarm program
Wyrd is a text-based front-end to Remind, a sophisticated calendar and
alarm program. Remind's power lies in its programmability, and Wyrd
does not hide this capability behind flashy GUI dialogs. Rather, Wyrd
is designed to make you more efficient at editing your reminder files
directly. It also offers a scrollable timetable suitable for
visualizing your schedule at a glance. You can check out a screenshot,
or take a short tour with the flash demo (3.1 MB).

Unlike most of the calendar applications available today, Wyrd is
designed to be both lightweight and fast. Startup time is negligible,
UI navigation is instantaneous, and the wyrd process typically
consumes less than 2MB of resident memory.
