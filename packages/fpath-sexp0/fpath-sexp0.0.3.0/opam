description: """\

[Fpath_sexplib0] is an OCaml module designed to be opened to extend
the [fpath] package. It introduces three new modules to the scope:
[Fsegment], [Absolute_path] and [Relative_path].

[Absolute_path] and [Relative_path] are helper modules that
distinguish between classes of paths in the type system, enhancing
type safety for applications manipulating paths.

[Fpath] is shadowed and retains all its original functionality, with
the addition of a sexp serializer and new helpers for casting between
the types of paths offered by the package (absolute and relative
paths).
