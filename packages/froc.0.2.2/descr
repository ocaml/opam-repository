Jake Donham's Froc library for functional reactive programming in OCaml.

Uses what appears to be currently stable commit, `6068a1fab883ed9254bfeb53a1f9c15e8af0bb20` dated Oct 22, 2010, which updates tagged release `0.2a`. I've thus named the opam package `froc.0.2.2` following the logic that the tagged `0.2` and `0.2a` releases are `0.2.0` and `0.2.1` respectively.
