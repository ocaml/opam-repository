synopsis: "Convenient and human-readable bitmap manipulation"
description: """
Useful to manipulate binary string (i.e bitmaps) in a convenient and human-readable format.
Binbin sacrifices convenience at the expense of usability. Its best use-case is for testing
and exploratory work (on applied cryptography for example) rather than production use."""
