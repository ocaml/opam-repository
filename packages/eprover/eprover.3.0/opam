synopsis: "E Theorem Prover"
description: "E is a theorem prover for first-order and higher-order logic with equality. It accepts a problem specification, typically consisting of a number of first-order clauses or formulas, and a conjecture, in clausal or full first-order/higher-order form. The system will then try to find a formal proof for the conjecture, assuming the axioms."
