synopsis: "E Theorem Prover"
description: "E is a theorem prover for full first-order logic with equality. It accepts a problem specification, typically consisting of a number of first-order clauses or formulas, and a conjecture, again either in clausal or full first-order form. The system will then try to find a formal proof for the conjecture, assuming the axioms."
