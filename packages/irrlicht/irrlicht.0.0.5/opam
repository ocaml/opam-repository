synopsis: "An OCaml binding for the Irrlicht Engine"
description: """
The Irrlicht Engine is an open source high performance realtime 3D engine
written in C++. It is completely cross-platform, using D3D, OpenGL and its own
software renderers, and has all of the state-of-the-art features which can be
found in commercial 3d engines. We've got a huge active community, and there
are lots of projects in development that use the engine. You can find
enhancements for Irrlicht all over the web, like alternative terrain renderers,
portal renderers, exporters, world layers, tutorials, editors. And best of all:
It's completely free.

This binding is still in Alpha stage.
This version of the binding was tested with Irrlicht version 1.8.4
