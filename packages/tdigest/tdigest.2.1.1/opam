synopsis: "OCaml implementation of the T-Digest algorithm"
description: """
The T-Digest is a data structure and algorithm for constructing an approximate distribution for a collection of real numbers presented as a stream.

The T-Digest can estimate percentiles or quantiles extremely accurately even at the tails, while using a fraction of the space.

Additionally, the T-Digest is concatenable, making it a good fit for distributed systems. The internal state of a T-Digest can be exported as a binary string, and the concatenation of any number of those strings can then be imported to form a new T-Digest.
