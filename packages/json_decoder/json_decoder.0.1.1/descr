JSON Decoder is an OCaml module that enables flexible decoding of JSON values.
It is based on Elm's Json.Decode module with a few tweaks.

This module allows you to do things like decode a field based on the type or
content of some other field, or even the failure to decode some other field.
It allows you to shape the results of a decode into a structure of your choice.

Rather than unpacking a JSON value directly into an analogous OCaml structure;
this module helps you to massage data into the shape you want by describing
the transformations that need to take place.
