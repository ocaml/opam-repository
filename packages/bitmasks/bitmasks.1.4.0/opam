synopsis: "BitMasks over int and int64 exposed as sets"
description: """
Library for exposing bitmasks (typically as int or int64) in an
implementation compatible with OCaml's Set. The underlying data
representation is unaltered, allowing the value to be manipulated
either as a bitmask or as a set without conversion."""
