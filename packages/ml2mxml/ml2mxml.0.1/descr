Generate musicxml files from OCaml

ml2mxml is an OCaml library to generate musicxml (http://www.musicxml.com/) files.

That library has been developed for two reasons:

- the lack of what 'git' offers, in music partition editors,
- the personal lack of skills when using cut/copy/paste features of Guitar Pro 6
  to repeat some partitions from one measure/instrument to others.

With that library, music can be written as:

- write an ocaml program (see examples/hello_ode_of_joy.ml),
- compile/execute it (% omake ex),
- and open the generated musicxml file
  with for example a midi player that understands the format (see http://www.musicxml.com/software/).
