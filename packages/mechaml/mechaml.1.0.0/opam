synopsis:
  "Functional web scraping library based on Cohttp, Lambdasoup and Lwt"
description: """
Mechaml is a web scraping library that allows to :
* Fetch web content
* Analyze, fill and submit HTML forms
* Handle cookies, headers and redirections

Mechaml is built on top of existing libraries that provide low-level features : Cohttp (https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp) and
Lwt (https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt) for asynchronous I/O and HTTP handling, and
 Lambdasoup (https://github.com/aantron/lambda-soup) to parse HTML. It provides
an interface that handles the interactions between these and add a few
other features."""
