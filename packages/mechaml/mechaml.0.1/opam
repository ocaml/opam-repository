synopsis: "A Mechanize-like web scraping library"
description: """
Mechaml is a simple web scraping library that allows to :
* Fetch web content
* Analyze, fill and submit HTML forms
* Handle cookies, headers and redirections
* Use a web proxy **(soon to be implemented)**

Mechaml is built on top of existing libraries that alreay provide most of the
interesting features : Cohttp and Lwt for asynchronous I/O and HTTP handling,
and Lambdasoup to parse HTML. It provides an interface that handles the
interactions between these and add useful features."""
