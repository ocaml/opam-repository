synopsis: "Simple and lightweight sequence abstract data type."
description: """
Simple sequence abstract data type, intended to transfer a finite number of
elements from one data structure to another. Some transformations on sequences,
like `filter`, `map`, `take`, `drop` and `append` can be performed before the
sequence is iterated/folded on."""
