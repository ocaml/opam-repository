synopsis:
  "A tool to facilitate the installation of OCaml annotation files (.cmt, .cmti, .spot, .spit)."
description: """
Many existing OCaml libraries, applications and the compiler itself do
not produce or install the annotation files (.annot, .cmt, .cmti,
.spot, .spit) which are essential for sub-expression type queries
(caml-types.el), definition seaches and code refactoring (TypeRex and
OCamlSpotter). If you want to use development tools, you have to:

* Rebuild all the software from the source, adding -annot/-bin-annot
  option to compiler flags in build scripts
  i.e. Makefile/OCamlBuild/OMakefile.

* Install those annotation files together with the library objects and
  signatures. (Require modification of the build scripts)

for all the programs.

SpotInstall provides a post-installation workaround, consists of two things:

* A very small compiler patch which activates -annot and -bin-annot if OCAML_ANNOT environment variable is defined. (You no longder need to add -annot/-bin-annot to the build scripts.)
* A small tool to install annotation files to the library destination directory. (You no longer need to add annotation file installation to the build scripts.)

For the first workaround, you need a small patch available from::

    hg clone -b annot https://bitbucket.org/camlspotter/mutated_ocaml

or included in this source package, ocaml-annot-<version>.patch.

For the second one, you can use SpotInstall. This tool."""
