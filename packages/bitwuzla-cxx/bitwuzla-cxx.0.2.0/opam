description: """

OCaml binding for the SMT solver Bitwuzla C++ API.

Bitwuzla is a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver for the theories of fixed-size bit-vectors, arrays and uninterpreted functions and their combinations. Its name is derived from an Austrian dialect expression that can be translated as “someone who tinkers with bits”."""
