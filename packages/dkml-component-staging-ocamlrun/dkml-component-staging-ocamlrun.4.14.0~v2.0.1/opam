      #     in the staging-files/darwin_arm64 directory,
      #     and that ocamlopt.opt will create x86_64 OCaml native executables. So that darwin_arm64/bin/ocamlopt.opt will not
      #     run on an x86_64 machine.
      #     The -adarwin_arm64 configuration is similar but has one important difference. The config will produce an x86_64
      #     ocamlopt.opt, in the staging-files/darwin_x86_64 directory, and that ocamlopt.opt will create arm64 OCaml native
      #     executables. But that darwin_x86_64/bin/ocamlopt.opt _will_ run on almost _all_ Apple Silicon (arm64) machines
      #     because of Rosetta2. The only major exception is Opam CI has disabled Rosetta2 as of Nov 8, 2022.

      #     -adarwin_x86_64-darwin_arm64. But that cross specification has ripple effects that needs time (technical debt) to
      #     get right. Luckily our build machines are always Apple x86_64 (GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD), and even if the
      #     build machines were Apple Silicon we typically only care about the generated artifacts (the target ABI).

  # Second pass
  #   For platforms that can do multiple _host_ ABIs _without_ cross-compiling.
  #   * MSVC can trivially do 32-bit and 64-bit without cross-compiling.
  #   * Most often Linux can as well as long as `gcc -m32` is configured.
  #     However for ease of use in GitHub Actions we expect Linux 32-bit and
