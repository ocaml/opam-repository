synopsis: "Simpler crypto"
description: """
nocrypto is a small cryptographic library that puts emphasis on the applicative
style and ease of use. It includes basic ciphers (AES, 3DES, RC4), hashes (MD5,
SHA1, SHA2), public-key primitives (RSA, DSA, DH) and a strong RNG (Fortuna).

RSA timing attacks are countered by blinding. AES timing attacks are avoided by
delegating to AES-NI."""
