description: """

State Dimension Logic is a package that provides functionality for storing data about a robot in a single place (finite state machine).
It allows you to more safely and systematcally organize and access the data.

Notably, while it's intended use is robotics, it can also be used for any project where similar logic is happening tick by tick.
