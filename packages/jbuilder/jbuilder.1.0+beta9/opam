  # ocamlfind is not mandatory to build packages using
  # jbuilder. However if it is present jbuilder will use it.  Making
  # it a hard-dependency avoids problems when there is a previous
  # ocamlfind in the PATH. We make it a "build" depepdency even though
  # it is only a runtime dependency so that reinstalling ocamlfind
  # doesn't resintall jbuilder
