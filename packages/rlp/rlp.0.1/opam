synopsis: "RLP: Recursive Length Prefix Encoding"
description: """
RLP(*1) is a way to encode multi-way trees as byte strings. This library provides an encode and a decode function.
A tree's node can be a byte string or a node with arbitrarily many child nodes. A node can also have zero nodes.
Equivalently, this library can serialize s-expressions whose atoms are byte string literals.

RLP is heavily used in the Ethereum protocol(*2), but might be useful elsewhere as well.
