synopsis: "A library for writing fast and memory-efficient serializers."
description: """
Faraday is a library for writing fast and memory-efficient serializers. Its
core type and related operation gives the user fine-grained control over
copying and allocation behavior while serializing user-defined types, and
presents the output in a form that makes it possible to use vectorized write
operations, such as the writev system call, or any other platform or
application-specific output APIs."""
