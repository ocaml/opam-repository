Combinators for Type Conversion in OCaml.

CConv provides type-safe combinators for describing how to read/build OCaml
values of a given type. Those combinators can be used for serializing and
deserializing the values into several formats. The library ships with
conversion to Json (yojson), S-expressions (sexplib) and B-encode.
