synopsis:
  "Rdr is a cross-platform binary analysis and reverse engineering library,"
description: """
utilizing a unique symbol map for global analysis.

`rdr` is an OCaml tool/library for doing cross-platform analysis of binaries,
by printing headers, locating entry points, showing import and export
symbols, their binary offsets and size, etc.

It also features a symbol map which allows fast lookups for arbitrary
symbols, and their associated data, on your system
(the default search location are binaries in /usr/lib).

The latest release also makes `rdr` a package which you can link against
and use in your own projects.

See the README at http://github.com/m4b/rdr for more details.

Features:

* 64-bit Linux and Mach-o binary analysis
* Searchable symbol-map of all the symbols on your system, including binary
  offset, size, and exporting library
* Print imports and exports of binaries
* Make pretty graphs, at the binary or symbol map level
* Byte Coverage algorithm which marks byte sequences as understood (or not)
  and provides other meta-data"""
