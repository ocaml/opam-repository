Collection of modules for asynchronous network applications
It is intended as a simpler alternative to the use of
the impressive ocamlnet package(s).

The modules contain an eventloop implementation, and parsers for some
common protocols.

The eventloop module is based on epoll for Linux, and defaults to
OCaml's Unix.select on other platforms.  It should be straightforward
to bind to alternatives like kqueue on other platforms.

Parsers and connection implementations exist for the HTTP/1.1 and
D-Bus protocols.  Parsers also exist for the JSON, JSONRPC and Bencode
formats.

Two code-generators are provided to ease the use of JSON and JSONRPC.
One (json_convert) generates code to convert between OCaml native
types and JSON.  Another (gen_rpc) generates code for the client and
server portions of a JSONRPC server, using an IDL description for the
messages in the RPC protocol.
