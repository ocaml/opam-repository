Umbrella for a collection of libraries supporting functional programming with
managed effects. The umbrella contains only documentation. See the following
packages to get the functionality:

- fmlib_std: A lot of standard data types.

- fmlib_parse: Monadic parsing functions with combinators suitable for
  incremental and indentation sensitive parsing.

- fmlib_pretty: Pretty printing functions. Prints hierachical structures like
  expressions and indented paragraphs nicely.

- fmlib_js: Interface to javscript via js_of_ocaml.
