Functional Priority Search Queues


psq provides a functional priority search queue for OCaml. This structure
behaves both as a finite map, containing bindings `k -> p`, and a priority queue
over `p`. It provides efficient access along more than one axis: to any binding
by `k`, and to the binding(s) with the least `p`.

Typical applications are searches, schedulers and caches. If you ever scratched
your head because that A\* didn't look quite right, a PSQ is what you needed.

The implementation is backed by [priority search pennants][hinze].

psq is distributed under the ISC license.
