synopsis: "An OCaml library for HTTP clients and servers"
description: """
Cohttp is an OCaml library for creating HTTP daemons. It has a portable
HTTP parser, and implementations using various asynchronous programming
libraries.

See the cohttp-async, cohttp-lwt, cohttp-lwt-unix, cohttp-lwt-jsoo and
cohttp-mirage libraries for concrete implementations for particular
targets.

You can implement other targets using the parser very easily. Look at the `IO`
signature in `lib/s.mli` and implement that in the desired backend.

You can activate some runtime debugging by setting `COHTTP_DEBUG` to any
value, and all requests and responses will be written to stderr.  Further
debugging of the connection layer can be obtained by setting `CONDUIT_DEBUG`
to any value.
