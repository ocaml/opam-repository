synopsis: "Syncweb, Literate Programming meets Unison"
description: """
Syncweb is a command-line tool enabling programmers to use the
literate programming[1] development methodology, using the noweb[2]
tool, while still being able to modify the generated files
from the literate document. syncweb provides a way to
"synchronize" the possibly modified original document with its
possibly modified views with an interface similar to unison[3]. In
addition, syncweb synchronizes data at a fine grained level by
computing and storing md5sum of the different chunks.
