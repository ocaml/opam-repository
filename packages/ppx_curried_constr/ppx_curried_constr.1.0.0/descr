ppx_curried_constr: ppx extension for curried constructors
# Variant constructors as functions

Suppose we have:

```ocaml
type t = Foo of int * float
```

Then

```ocaml
Foo
```

is equal to `fun (x,y) -> Foo (x,y)`. And,

```
!Foo
```

is equal to `fun x y -> Foo (x,y)`.

# Polymorphic variants as functions

```ocaml
!`Foo
```

is equivalent to 

```ocaml
fun x -> `Foo x
```

Note that ``!`Foo`` always take only one argument:
the arity of the polymorphic variant constructors is at most one
and  it is determined purely syntactically. 


```ocaml
!`Foo (1,2,3)  (* `Foo (1,2,3) *)
!`Foo 1 2 3    (* (`Foo 1) 2 3  which ends in a type error *)
```

Code ``(`Foo)`` has no special meaning. It is just equivalent to `` `Foo``.

# How to build

```shell
$ omake
$ omake install
```

or `opam install ppx_curried_constr`.

# How to use

```shell
$ ocamlfind ocamlc -package ppx_curried_constr ...
```

# Samples

You can try examples at `tests/test.ml`:

```
$ ocaml -ppx src/ppx_curried_constr -c -i tests/test.ml
```

To check the output,

```
$ src/ppx_curried_constr -debug tests/test.ml
```

# Limitations

## No support of REPL (toplevel)

`ppx_currired_constr` is a "typeful PPX" which performs typing in it.
It does not work with OCaml REPL (`ocaml` command), where ppx commands
are called for each toplevel phrase without carrying over the type environment.

Do you use REPL?  Personally, I use it only as a calculator.

## Cons constructor

Cons constructor `(::)` is specially handled in OCaml
and it is outside of the support of `ppx_curried_constr`.
