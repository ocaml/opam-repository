synopsis:
  "ocaml-unix-sys-stat provides access to the features exposed in sys/stat.h in a way that is not tied to the implementation on the host system."
description: """
The Sys_stat module provides functions for translating between the file types and mode bits accessible through sys/stat.h and their values on particular systems. The Sys_stat_host module exports representations of various hosts.

The Sys_stat_unix provides bindings to functions that use the types in Sys_stat along with a representation of the host system. The bindings support a more comprehensive range of flags than the corresponding functions in the standard OCaml Unix module."""
