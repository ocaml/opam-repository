synopsis: "The Dumbest Http Client"
description: """
Curly is a brain dead wrapper around the curl command line utility designed to
provide a 0 dependency solution for applications that want to create some very
simple HTTP requests. It is not blazing fast, or async, but at least it involves
no C bindings, it's trivial to vendor, and the API can be learned in 5 minutes.

Here's a simple example:

```ocaml

match Curly.(run (Request.make ~url:"https://opam.ocaml.org" ~meth:`GET ())) with
| Ok x ->
  Format.printf "status: %d\\n" x.Curly.Response.code;
  Format.printf "headers: %a\\n" Curly.Header.pp x.Curly.Response.headers;
  Format.printf "body: %s\\n" x.Curly.Response.body
| Error e ->
  Format.printf "Failed: %a" Curly.Error.pp e
```

There's not much more to it than this. Consult curly.mli to see how to construct
various requests and read responses."""
