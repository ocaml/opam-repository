ORakuda, Perlish string literals in OCaml
ORakuda is a small library, CamlP4 extensions and an optional tiny
patch to CamlP4 which provides a handy way to write OCaml scripts a la
Perl (or other scripting language). It provides syntax like:

* PCRE expression and matching of Perl like syntax $/.../ or <:m<...>>
* Variable and expression references in string $"..." or <:qq<...>>
* Sub-shell call by back-quotes $`...` or <:qx<...>>
* Easy hashtbl access tbl${key}
