synopsis: "Jsonxt - JSON parsers for files, strings and more"
description: """\
Jsonxt provides a number of JSON parsers and writers for
RFC 8259 compliant JSON as well as non-standard extensions
introduced by Yojson.  Features include

* RFC 8259 compliant when in strict and basic mode
* Performance focused especially for files and strings
* Support for standard and extended JSON tree types:
  * Strict follows a strict interpretation of RFC 8259 with all
    numbers represented as floats.
  * Basic extends the strict type to include convenience types while maintaining
    RFC compliance.  This is compatible with yojson's Basic type
  * Extended adds additional non-standard types including tuples and variants
    and is not RFC compliant. This is compatible with yojson's Safe type
* A number of different parsers including
  * A standard JSON tree parser for various sources including string, file and channel
  * A Stream parser that returns a stream of raw JSON tokens.
  * A monad based parser compatible with async
* Writers including
  * File and string writers
  * A monad based writer that is compatible with async
  * A stream writer that converts a stream of JSON tokens
* Support for streaming JSON via Stream.t
* Standard interfaces including Yojson compatibility"""
