synopsis: "Code coverage for OCaml"
description: """
Bisect_ppx helps you test thoroughly. It is a small preprocessor that inserts
instrumentation at places in your code, such as if-then-else and match
expressions. After you run tests, Bisect_ppx gives a nice HTML report showing
which places were visited and which were missed.

Usage is simple - add package bisect_ppx when building tests, then run the
report tool on the generated visitation files.

This is an advanced fork of the original Bisect coverage tool. It has many
improvements and updates.

- Much more thorough code instrumentation, so you can find more gaps in your
  testing.
- Fast operation by default.
- More legible and appealing HTML reports.
- Various bugfixes.
- No camlp4 dependency."""
