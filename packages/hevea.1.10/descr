A quite complete and fast LATEX to HTML translator
HEVEA is a LATEX to HTML translator. The input language is a fairly
complete subset of LATEX 2Ñ” (old LATEX style is also accepted) and the
output language is HTML that is (hopefully) correct with respect to
version 4.0 transitional.  Recent versions of most browsers offer
support for Unicode (ISO 10646) characters, albeit to different
extents. HEVEA exploits this fact to translate various math symbols
used in LATEX. As a result, almost the entire set of math symbols,
including the amssymb ones, are correctly rendered. The use of the
symbol font browsers is no longer the default.

HEVEA understands LATEX macro definitions. Simple user style files are
understood with little or no modifications. Furthermore, HEVEA
customization is done by writing LATEX code.

HEVEA is written in Objective Caml, as many lexers. It is quite fast
and flexible. Using HEVEA it is possible to translate large documents
such as manuals, books, etc. very quickly. All documents are
translated as one single HTML file. Then, the output file can be cut
into smaller files, using the companion program HACHA.

HEVEA can also be instructed to output plain text or info files.
