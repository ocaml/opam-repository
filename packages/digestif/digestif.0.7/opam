synopsis:     "Hashes implementations (SHA*, RIPEMD160, BLAKE2* and MD5) and HMAC of them"
description: """
Digestif is a toolbox to provide hashes implementations in C and OCaml.

It uses the linking trick and user can decide at the end to use the C implementation or the OCaml implementation
from a shared interface. As a library, you should link with digestif, as an executable, you should choose between
digestif.c or digestif.ocaml package.

We provides implementation of:
 * MD5
 * SHA1
 * SHA224
 * SHA256
 * SHA384
 * SHA512
 * BLAKE2B
 * BLAKE2S
 * RIPEMD160

And HMAC of them.
