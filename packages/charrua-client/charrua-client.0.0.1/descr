charrua-client is a DHCP client powered by [charrua-core](https://github.com/haesbaert/charrua-core).

The base library exposes a simple state machine for acquiring a DHCP lease.

An optional sublibrary, `charrua-client.mirage`, exposes an additional functor for use with the [MirageOS library operating system](https://github.com/mirage/mirage).
