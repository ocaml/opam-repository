TPLib: Tropical Polyhedra Library

TPLib implements several algorithms to manipulate tropical polyhedra. Among 
others, it allows to compute:
* the extreme points and rays of tropical polyhedra, 
* tropical polar cones,
* the minimal representations by means of half-spaces,
* the tropical complex associated with a tropical polytope.

TPLib also provides abstract operations over tropical polyhedra (intersections,
convex hull of unions, etc), which are typically useful in applications to 
formal verification.
