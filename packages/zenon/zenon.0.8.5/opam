synopsis: "An Extensible Automated Theorem Prover Producing Checkable Proofs"
description: """
Automated theorem prover for first order classical logic (with
equality), based on the tableau method. Zenon handles first-order
logic with equality. Its most important feature is that it outputs the
proofs of the theorems, in Coq-checkable form."""
