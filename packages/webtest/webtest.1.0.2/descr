Framework for in-browser testing of js_of_ocaml code

Webtest is a testing framework, fully compatible with js_of_ocaml, and written
with in-browser testing of JavaScript code in mind.

You may find it useful if you want to test bindings to an existing JavaScript
library, or to test that your code behaves as expected when compiled to
JavaScript.

As well as providing OUnit-style combinators for building tests and test suites,
Webtest implements a simple JavaScript API for integration with browser
automation tools such as Selenium WebDriver.
