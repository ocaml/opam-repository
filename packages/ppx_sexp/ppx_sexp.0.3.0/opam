synopsis:
  "ppx_sexp is a ppx preprocessor for embedding S-expressions in OCaml programs."
description: """
For example, this:

    [%sexp (define a "hi there!")]

is translated into:

    `List [`Symbol "define"; `Symbol "a"; `String "hi there"]

You can unquote, or insert regular OCaml expressions inside of the S-expression that will be evaluated instead of converted to atoms (e.g. `List`, `Symbol`) using the `[%in ...]` syntax:

    let a = [%sexp (title "Hello, world!")] in
    [%sexp (html
              (head
                 [%in a])
              (body
                 (p "Hi there!")))]

When inserting values, you must make sure to contain them in the appropriate polymorphic variant (the names correspond directly to OCaml's AST constant types, with the exception of Bool):

     [%sexp (print [%in `String "S-expressions: abbreviated sexp"])]

The `%in` syntax is intended to be used for embedding other S-expressions. 
If you are embedding atoms, there is a streamlined syntax:

     [%sexp (print [%string "S-expressions: sexp"])]

Unquote-splicing is also supported."""
