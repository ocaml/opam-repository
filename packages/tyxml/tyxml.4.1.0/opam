synopsis:
  "TyXML is a library for building statically correct HTML5 and SVG documents"
description: """
TyXML allows you to build HTML5 and SVG trees whose validity is ensured by the typechecker.
It provides a printer for said XML trees, along with a ppx syntax extension.
Finally it also provides a functorial interface to choose your XML datastructure.
It's part of the ocsigen project and is used in js_of_ocaml and eliom."""
