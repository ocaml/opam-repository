synopsis: "Unix time.h types, maps, and support"
description: """
unix-time provides access to the features exposed in time.h in a way
that is not tied to the implementation on the host system.

The Time module provides types which are analogous to those defined in
time.h such as timespec.

The Time_unix module provides a ctypes view for timespec."""
