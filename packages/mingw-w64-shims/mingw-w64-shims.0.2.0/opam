opam-version: "2.0"
synopsis: "Configuration for the mingw-w64 Cygwin packages in opam"
description: """
The mingw-w64 ports of OCaml require access to both GCC and the assembler. This
package performs two tasks. Firstly, it adds the directory containing the
runtime DLLS to PATH; for example, a typical Cygwin installation requires
C:\\cygwin64\\usr\\x86_64-w64-mingw32\\sys-root\\mingw\\bin
to be added to PATH.

Secondly, for opam's internally managed Cygwin installation, it installs shim
executables to provide the cygpath utility along with all tool-prefixed
programs from the -gcc-core, -gcc-g++ and -binutils packages from the
mingw64-i686 and mingw64-x86_64 package sets."""
