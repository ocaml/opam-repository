synopsis: "Faster, simpler and more portable implementation of `jq` in OCaml"
description: """
query-json is a faster and simpler re-implementation of jq's language in OCaml, compiled to a native binary (query-json) and as a JavaScript library (query-json-js).

  query-json is a CLI to run small programs against JSON, the same idea as sed but for JSON files.

  Play with it in the online playground: https://query-json.netlify.app"""
