synopsis: "Portable shim for MirageOS OS API"
description: """
mirage-os-shim is the intersection of the Mirage OS APIs exported under the `OS`
modules by various Mirage backends. It shims out this interface under the same
`cmi`, and installs several implementations, that pass through to their
respective backends.

Clients need to be compiled against the common `mirage_OS.cmi`, and use the
module `Mirage_OS`. Final applications need to be linked using `ocamlfind`, and
have to define one of the `ocamlfind` predicates corresponding to the actual
`OS` implementations: `mirage_unix`, `mirage_xen`, or `mirage_solo5`.

When using `ocamlbuild`, this is
`ocamlfind -use-ocamlfind -tag 'predicate(unix)'` or similar.

**WARNING** Direct access to the `OS` interface is largely deprecated. The
interface is pretty volatile. It is highly likely that you, in fact, do not need
this package at all.
