Bindings for the PostgreSQL database 
This OCaml-library provides an interface to PostgreSQL, an efficient
and reliable, open source, relational database. Almost all
functionality available through the C-API (libpq) is replicated in a
type-safe way. This library uses objects for representing database
connections and results of queries.

This is an up-to-date version of package "postgres"
