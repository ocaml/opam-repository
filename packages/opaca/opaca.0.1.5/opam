synopsis: "A friendly OCaml project scaffolding tool"
description: """
Opaca quickly sets up a basic project to be used with jbuilder[link?] and topkg[link?]

simply run `opaca new 'name'` to scaffold a library project,
or `opaca new 'name' --bin` to scaffold an executable project.

It doesn't do much beyond that"""
