  "Jsoo_broadcastchannel is a binding for the BroadcastChannel API for Js_of_OCaml."
description: """
Jsoo_broadcastchannel is a binding for the BroadcastChannel API. 
The BroadcastChannel interface represents a named channel that any browsing context of a given origin can subscribe to. 
It allows communication between different documents (in different windows, tabs, frames or iframes) of the same origin. 
Messages are broadcasted via a message event fired at all BroadcastChannel objects listening to the channel."""
