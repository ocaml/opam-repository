MacOS X implementation of the MirageOS NETWORK interface

This interface exposes raw Ethernet frames using the
[Vmnet](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-vmnet) framework that
is available on MacOS X Yosemite onwards.  It is suitable for
use with an OCaml network stack such as the one found at
<https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip>.

For a complete system that uses this, please see the
[MirageOS](http://openmirage.org) homepage.
