synopsis: "Proof-tree visualization for Coq via Proof General"
description: """
Prooftree visualizes proof trees during proof development in Coq with
Proof General. Prooftree helps against getting lost between different
subgoals in interactive proof development. It clearly shows where the
current subgoal comes from and thus helps in developing the right plan
for solving it.
