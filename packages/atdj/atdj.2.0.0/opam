synopsis: "Java code generation for ATD."
description: """
Atdj is a program that generates a Java interface from type
definitions. In particular, given a set of ATD type definitions, this
tool generates a set of Java classes representing those types with
built-in JSON serializers and deserializers.

The primary benefits of using the generated interface, over manually
manipulating JSON strings from within Java, are safety and ease of
use. Specifically, the generated interface offers the following
features:

- JSON strings are automatically checked for correctness with respect
  to the ATD specification.

- Details such as optional fields and their associated default values
  are automatically handled."""
