synopsis: "Binary Analysis Platform"
description: """
The Carnegie Mellon University Binary Analysis Platform (CMU BAP) is a
reverse engineering and program analysis platform that works with
binary code and doesn't require the source code. BAP supports multiple
architectures: ARM, x86, x86-64, PowerPC, and MIPS. BAP disassembles
and lifts binary code into the RISC-like BAP Instruction Language
(BIL). Program analysis is performed using the BIL representation and
is architecture independent in a sense that it will work equally well
for all supported architectures. The main purpose of BAP is to provide
a toolkit for implementing automated program analysis. BAP is written
in OCaml and it is the preferred language to write analysis, but we
have bindings to C, Python and Rust. The Primus Framework also provide
a Lisp-like DSL for writing program analysis tools.

This is a meta package that installs essential parts of BAP."""
