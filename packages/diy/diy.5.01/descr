Tool suite for testing shared memory models

`(don't) diy` is a tool suite: `litmus` runs assembly tests against
hardware, `diy` proper generates assembly tests from concise
specifications, and `don't` automatically either checks the
conformance of a machine to a given model, or explores the features
exhibited by a machine.
