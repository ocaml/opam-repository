synopsis: "Scheduling and executing shell jobs"
description: """
The builder server has a schedule of jobs to be executed, stored persistently
on disk. Any number of workers can connect via TCP (using ASN.1 encoded
messages) that execute a single job -- usually contained in a sandbox (FreeBSD
jail or Docker container). A client is a command-line interface to modify the
schedule. Access control is out of scope - run it locally on your build host.
The server receives the output artifacts of each job, and either stores them
on the local file system or upload them to a remote server via http.

See https://builds.robur.coop for the live web frontend (builder-web).
