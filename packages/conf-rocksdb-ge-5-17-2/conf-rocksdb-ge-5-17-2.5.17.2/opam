synopsis: "Virtual package relying on a system installation of RocksDB (version >= 5.17.2)"
description: """
The build section merits an explanation.

(1) for debian 11/12, conf-rocksdb ensures that rocksdb gets installed.  But it'll be backlevel,
and specifically either 5.17.2 or 6.11.4 -- versions that do not come with pkg-config files.
So we just skip the test.

(2) For all other OS versions, we check what pkg-config says.
