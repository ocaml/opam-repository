synopsis: "Elliptic curve library secp256k1 wrapper for Ocaml"
description: """
This library wrap the secp256k1 EC(DSA) library into an OCaml library. At 
the moment only a subset of functionalities are available:

- Context: create, clone, destroy, randomize
- Elliptic curve: public key creation
- ECDSA: verify, sign


All exchanged data (pubkey, signature, seckey) are represented as hex 
strings."""
