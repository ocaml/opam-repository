synopsis: "A tool for writing definitions of programming languages and calculi"
description: """
Ott takes as input a definition of a language syntax and semantics, in a
concise and readable ASCII notation that is close to what one would write in
informal mathematics.  It generates output:
- a LaTeX source file that defines commands to build a typeset version of the definition;
- a Coq version of the definition;
- a HOL version of the definition;
- an Isabelle/HOL version of the definition;
- a Lem version of the definition;
- an OCaml version of the syntax of the definition.
Additionally, it can be run as a filter, taking a
LaTeX/Coq/Isabelle/HOL/Lem/OCaml source file
with embedded (symbolic) terms of the defined language, parsing them and
replacing them by typeset terms.
