synopsis:
  "Ott is a tool for writing definitions of programming languages and calculi"
description: """
It takes as input a definition of a language syntax and semantics, in a concise
and readable ASCII notation that is close to what one would write in informal
mathematics. It generates LaTeX to build a typeset version of the definition,
and Coq, HOL, and Isabelle versions of the definition. Additionally, it can be
run as a filter, taking a LaTeX/Coq/Isabelle/HOL source file with embedded
(symbolic) terms of the defined language, parsing them and replacing them by
target-system terms."""
