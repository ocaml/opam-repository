synopsis: "User-space installer for the NLopt library"
description: """
Attempt a user-space installation of NLopt.
If successful, libnlopt will be installed
into opam's lib directory.
Note: NLopt is a C++ library which is required by some OCaml
software in opam-repository.
Having an automatic user-space installer in opam-repos. will make those
software easier to install (e.g. even if you don't have root access
to install the corresponding system package).
