synopsis: "RFC 1035 Internet domain names"
description: """
A domain name is a sequence of labels separated by dots, such as `foo.example`.
Each label may contain any bytes. The length of each label may not exceed 63
charactes.  The total length of a domain name is limited to 253 (byte
representation is 255), but other protocols (such as SMTP) may apply even
smaller limits.  A domain name label is case preserving, comparison is done in a
case insensitive manner.
