synopsis: "Differential FRP based on the React library"
description: """
Cumulus defines a signal-like type, which facilitates differential updates
of the underlying value. When a cumulus signal is changed, it emits a patch
along with the new value, allowing consumers to integrate it into an
existing value rather than rebuilding its value from scratch. Cumulus is
based on the React FRP library.
