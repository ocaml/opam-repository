synopsis: "Library implementing parsing of image formats such as PNG, BMP, PPM"
description:
"""
The imagelib library implements image formats such as PNG, BMP, and PPM in
OCaml, relying on only one external dependency: 'decompress'.

Unix-dependent functionality such as reading or writing to files in the
filesystem are packaged in the `imagelib.unix` findlib module inside this
OPAM package; to use it you need to include `imagelib.unix` specifically
in your project's dependencies, for instance `(libraries imagelib.unix)`
in your Dune file.

Supported image formats:
 - PNG (full implementation of RFC 2083),
 - PPM, PGM, PBM, ... (fully supported),
 - BMP (read-only)
 - JPG (only image size natively),
 - GIF (only image size natively),
    - There is an experimental native implementation available in the pure `ImageLib` module.
 - XCF (only image size natively),
 - Utility functions for handling unimplemented formats are available in
   the 'imagelib.unix' findlib package and handle conversion from unsupported
   image formats like JPG, GIF, XCF by converting them to PNG using the
   `convert` commandline utility from `imagemagick`.

As imagelib only requires `decompress`, it is suitable (excluding operations
requiring the `imagemagick` `convert` binary) for compilation to javascript
using `js_of_ocaml`, or inclusion in MirageOS unikernels.

`app/imagetool.ml` contains an example binary that acts as a command-line interface to many of the functions in the library. It will be installed as `imagetool` or `imagetool.exe` if you use **opam** to install the library, and otherwise it will be in `_build/default/app/imagetool.exe`
