The imagelib library implements image formats such as PNG or PPM

The imagelib library implements image formats such as PNG or PPM  in
OCaml, relying on only one external dependency: camlzip. However, we
plan to reimplement zlib in OCaml at some point.

Supported image formats:
 - PNG (full implementation of RCF 2083),
 - PPM, PGM, PBM, ... (fully supported),
 - JPG (only image size natively, conversion to PNG otherwise),
 - GIF (only image size natively, conversion to PNG otherwise),
 - XCF (only image size natively, conversion to PNG otherwise),
 - Other formats rely on convert (imagemagick).

As imagelib only requires camlzip, it is suitable for compilation to
javascript using js_of_ocaml (only for operations not requireing the
convert binary).
