Linux kernel AIO access library for ocaml

Use this if you want very efficient I/O on Linux. Note this is not
an implementation of "POSIX AIO".

Linux AIO allows a single thread to submit multiple I/O operations and
perform other computations while they are in progress. To increase
efficiency, all data is read and written in page-aligned buffers.
