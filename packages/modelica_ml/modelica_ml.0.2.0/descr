Modelica abstract syntax and parser

Modelica.ml is a Modelica frontend implemented in OCaml.
It is written with compilation in mind, but should also be
useful for other applications.

Currently, abstract syntax, parsing, pretty printing and
a form of lookup analysis are implemented. Patches welcome!
