synopsis: "Unix fcntl.h types, maps, and support"
description: """
unix-fcntl provides access to the features exposed in fcntl.h in a way
that is not tied to the implementation on the host system.

The Fcntl module provides functions for translating between the names
of the flags exposed in fcntl.h and their values on particular
systems. The Fcntl_host module exports representations of various
hosts.

The Fcntl_unix provides bindings to functions that use the flags in
Fcntl along with a representation of the host system. The bindings
support a more comprehensive range of flags than the corresponding
functions in the standard OCaml Unix module. The Fcntl_unix_lwt module
exports non-blocking versions of the functions in Fcntl_unix based on
the Lwt cooperative threading library."""
