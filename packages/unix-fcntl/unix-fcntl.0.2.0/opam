synopsis: "Unix fcntl.h types, maps, and support"
description: """
unix-fcntl provides types for manipulating concepts expressed in
fcntl.h. A macro definition type, defns is provided for open flags in
order to transport a specific openflag-integer map as is the case with
FUSE. The types and their functions reside in Fcntl and are independent
of any Unix bindings. This makes the library's types usable from
MirageOS on top of Xen. Fcntl_unix provides maps to and from
Unix.open_flag, the present host's open flag map, and similar."""
