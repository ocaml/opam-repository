synopsis: "Connecting to a remote host via IP version 4 or 6"
description: """
Happy eyeballs is an implementation of
[RFC 8305](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8305) which specifies how
to connect to a remote host using either IP protocol version 4 or IP protocol
version 6. This is the core of the algorithm in value passing style, with a
slick dependency cone.
