synopsis: "Git format and protocol in pure OCaml"
description: """
Support for on-disk and in-memory Git stores. Can read and write all
the Git objects: the usual blobs, trees, commits and tags but also
the pack files, pack indexes and the index file (where the staging area
lives).

All the objects share a consistent API, and convenience functions are
provided to manipulate the different objects. For instance, it is
possible to make a pack file position independent (as the Zlib
compression might change the relative offsets between the packed
objects), to generate pack indexes from pack files, or to expand
the filesystem of a given commit."""
