synopsis:
  "Regenerate is a tool to generate test-cases for regular expression engines."
description: """
Regenerate takes a regular expression and generates strings that match it.
It handles most posix extended regular expressions along with
complement (~a) and intersection (a&b).
Since it handles complement, it can also generate strings that
*don't* match a given regular expression."""
