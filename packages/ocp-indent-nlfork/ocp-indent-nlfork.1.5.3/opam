synopsis: "ocp-indent library, \"newline tokens\" fork"
description: """
This is a modified version of the ocp-indent library, which is based on a
different lexer, using newline tokens and banning multi-line ones, which is more
convenient for some applications.

The library is exported as `ocp-indent-nlfork`, so as not to interfere with
canonical ocp-indent installations.

This package does *not* install an ocp-indent binary or related tools."""
