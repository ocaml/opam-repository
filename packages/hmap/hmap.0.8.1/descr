Heterogeneous value maps for OCaml

Hmap provides heterogeneous value maps for OCaml. These maps bind keys
to values with arbitrary types. Keys witness the type of the value
they are bound to which allows to add and lookup bindings in a type
safe manner.

Hmap has no dependency and is distributed under the ISC license.
