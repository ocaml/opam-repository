post-messages:"new release that fixes some problems with 0.5.1,
including a better handling of backtraces, safe-string awareness,
a mode for long tests, and reverting `small_int` to being an alias to `nat`.

The latter point is important for not breaking code that would use `small_int`
to pick the size of lists, strings, etc. The new `small_signed_int` can
be used instead."
synopsis: "QuickCheck inspired property-based testing for OCaml."

This module allows to check invariants (properties of some types) over
randomly generated instances of the type. It provides combinators for
generating instances and printing them."""
