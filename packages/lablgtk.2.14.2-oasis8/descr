Objective Caml interface to gtk+
It uses the rich type system of Objective Caml 3 to provide a strongly
typed, yet very comfortable, object-oriented interface to gtk+. This
is not that easy if you know the dynamic typing approach taken by
gtk+.

It is still under development, but already fully functional. All
widgets (but one) are available, with almost all their methods. The
GLArea widget is also supported in combination with LablGL. LibGlade
and GdkPixbuf support is also included for both versions. LablGTK2
adds support for gnomecanvas, librsvg and libpanel Many examples are
provided.

Objective Caml threads are supported, including for the toplevel,
which allows for interactive use of the library.
