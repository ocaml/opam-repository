synopsis: "MPP is both a preprocessor and a meta preprocessor"
description: """
MPP is a simple preprocessor with a syntax you can parameterize
to match your needs.

MPP is also a meta processor that is meant to bring any programming
language to the preprocessing level. You can easily use OCaml, or
many other programming languages, as a preprocessor language for any
text-based document.
