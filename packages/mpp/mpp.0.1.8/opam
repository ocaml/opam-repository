synopsis: "A preprocessor meant to blend languages."
description: """
MPP is a meta processor that is meant to bring any programming
language to the preprocessing level. You can easily use OCaml as a
preprocessor language for any text-based document. If you want to use
another language, you just need to tell MPP how to use it. MPP also
works as a simple preprocessor, as it provides its own (tiny)
language."""
