A full-featured and extensible Web server

Ocsigen Server implements most features of the HTTP protocol, and has
a very powerful extension mechanism that makes it very easy to plug
your own OCaml modules for generating pages. Many extensions are
already implemented, like a reverse proxy, content compression, access
control, authentication, etc.
