opam-version: "2.0"
synopsis: "Offline install of Opam"
description: """
Offline install that places opam in the installation directory.

Depending on the end-user's integer size, as reported by Sys.int_size, either 32-bit or 64-bit opam will be installed.

On macOS the end-user target ABI can be either darwin_arm64 or darwin_x86_64 when you have both dkml-base-compiler and
conf-dkml-cross-toolchain installed in your switch, regardless whether your host's ABI is darwin_arm64 or darwin_x86.64.
Otherwise on macOS the target ABI must match the host ABI.

The package version, and what [opam --version] returns, are closely associated with the Opam version from the Opam
source code. The only modifications are to ensure that the package version can be ordered using semver. In particular:

* 2.2.0~alpha~dev -> 2.2.0~alpha0~20221231
* 2.2.0~alpha~1   -> 2.2.0~alpha1~20230601
* 2.2.0           -> 2.2.0

The dates (YYYYMMDD) are the Git commit dates in the Opam source code, and simply replacing the tildes (~) with dashes (-) is
sufficient to be a semver version.
