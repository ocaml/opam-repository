synopsis:
  "Links is a functional programming language designed to make web programming easier."
description: """
Links eases building interactive web applications with significant client- and
server-side components.

A typical, modern web program involves many "tiers": part of the program runs
in the web browser, part runs on a web server, and part runs in back-end
systems such as a relational database. To create such a program, the programmer
must master a myriad of languages: the logic is written in a mixture of Java,
Python, and Perl; the presentation in HTML; the GUI behavior in Javascript; and
the queries are written in SQL or XQuery. There is no easy way to link these,
for example, to be sure that an HTML form or an SQL query produces the type of
data that the Java code expects. This problem is called the impedance
mismatch problem.

Links eases the impedance mismatch problem by providing a single language for
all three tiers. The system generates code for each tier; for instance,
translating some code into Javascript for the browser, some into a bytecode for
the server, and some into SQL for the database.

Links incorporates proven ideas from other programming languages:
database-query support from Kleisli, web-interaction proposals from PLT Scheme,
and distributed-computing support from Erlang. On top of this, it adds some new
web-centric features of its own."""
