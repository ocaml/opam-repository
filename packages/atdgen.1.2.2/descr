Generates efficient JSON serializers, deserializers and validators
Atdgen is a command-line program that takes as input type definitions
in the ATD syntax and produces OCaml code suitable for data
serialization and deserialization.

Two data formats are currently supported for serialization, these are
JSON and Biniou, a binary format which retains most of JSON's
properties. Atdgen can also generate data validators derived from
annotated type definitions (starting with Atdgen 1.2.0).

Atdgen was designed with efficiency and durability in mind. Software
authors are encouraged to use Atdgen directly and to write tools that
may reuse part of Atdgen's source code.
