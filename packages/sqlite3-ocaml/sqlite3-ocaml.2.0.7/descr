sqlite3-ocaml - SQLite3 bindings
sqlite3-ocaml is an OCaml library with bindings to the SQLite3 client
API. Sqlite3 is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration,
transactional SQL database engine with outstanding performance for
many use cases. These bindings are written in a way that enables a
friendly coexistence with the old (version 2) SQLite and its OCaml
wrapper ocaml-sqlite.
