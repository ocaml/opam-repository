General helper library for js_of_ocaml

Runa is a collection of helper functions for `js_of_ocaml`
programming. It does not assume anything other than what is provided
by `js_of_ocaml`, aka no assumption of `nodejs`.  Use this library for
yourself as well and make your `OCaml` to `JavaScript` coding that
much easier; even better contribute some snippets as well!

To use in your programs, simply add `runa` to your ocamlfind
`-package` declaration(s), and be sure to do `-linkpkg` as well.
