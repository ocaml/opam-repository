Declarative definition of command line interfaces.

Cmdliner provides a simple and compositional mechanism to convert command line
arguments to OCaml values and pass them to your functions. The module
automatically handles syntax errors, help messages and UNIX man page
generation. It supports programs with single or multiple commands (like darcs
or git) and respect most of the POSIX and GNU conventions.
