Camlp5 is a preprocessor and pretty-printer for OCaml programs. It also provides parsing and printing tools.

redefine the whole syntax of the language.
As a pretty printer, it allows to:

display OCaml programs in an elegant way,
convert from one syntax to another,
check the results of syntax extensions.
Camlp5 also provides some parsing and pretty printing tools:

extensible grammars
extensible printers
stream parsers and lexers
