Camlp5 is a preprocessor and pretty-printer for OCaml programs. It also provides parsing and printing tools.

redefine the whole syntax of the language.
As a pretty printer, it allows to:

display OCaml programs in an elegant way,
convert from one syntax to another,
check the results of syntax extensions.
Camlp5 also provides some parsing and pretty printing tools:

extensible grammars
extensible printers
stream parsers and lexers

It works as a shell command and can also be used in the OCaml toplevel."""

  "To use mkcamlp5 and mkcamlp5.opt properly you will require Perl module which contains 'IPC/System/Simple.pm'. We currently don't know the right way to specify this dependecy on BSD and MacOS systems. You can use https://github.com/camlp5/camlp5/issues/66 for discussion."
