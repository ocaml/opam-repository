synopsis: "Typed routing for OCaml applications"
description: """
routes provides combinators for adding typed routing
to OCaml applications. The core library will be independent
of any particular web framework or runtime. It also provides
a `sprintf` like function (it uses the same representation of
a route as a 'format string') to reconstruct URLs.
