A complete yet small extension for OCaml standard library (reduced, recommended)
The purpose of this library is to add new functions to OCaml standard library
modules, to modify some functions in order to get better performances or
safety (tail-recursive) and also to provide new modules which should be useful
for the average OCaml programmer.
