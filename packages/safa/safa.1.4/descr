Symbolic Algorithms for Finite Automata

This OCaml library contains symbolic algorithms for checking language
equivalence or inclusion of automata with a large alphabet, using
symbolic representations (BDDs).

It is described in the following paper, in Proc. POPL'15
http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2676726.2677007

This library can be used to obtain symbolic algorithms for Kleene
algebra with tests (KAT), see library [symkat]
