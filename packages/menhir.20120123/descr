LR(1) parser generator
Menhir is a LR(1) parser generator for the OCaml programming
language. That is, Menhir compiles LR(1) grammar specifications down
to OCaml code. Menhir was designed and implemented by François Pottier
and Yann Régis-Gianas.

Menhir is 90% compatible with ocamlyacc. Legacy ocamlyacc grammar
specifications are accepted and compiled by Menhir. The resulting
parsers run and produce correct parse trees. However, parsers that
explicitly invoke functions in module Parsing behave slightly
incorrectly. For instance, the functions that provide access to
positions return a dummy position when invoked by a Menhir
parser. Porting a grammar specification from ocamlyacc to Menhir
requires replacing all calls to module Parsing with new
Menhir-specific keywords.
