opam-version: "2.0"
synopsis:
  "A front-end for the C programming language that facilitates program analysis and transformation"
description: """
This is a fork of the 'cil' package needed to build 'goblint'.
Changes:
- Proper support for C99 and VLAs in particular
- It uses Zarith instead of the deprecated Num
- Support for more recent OCaml versions (â‰¥ 4.06)
- Large integer constants that do not fit in an OCaml int are represented as a string instead of getting truncated
- Syntactic search extension
- More precise locations (with columns)
- Some warnings were made optional
- Unmaintained extensions were removed
- Many bug fixes"""
