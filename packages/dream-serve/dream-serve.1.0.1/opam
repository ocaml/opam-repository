synopsis: "Static HTML website server with live reload"

description: """
dream-serve serves a static HTML site. It injects a small script which reloads
Web pages when they are updated in the file system. This makes it great for
static site development, including odoc documentation pages, and for viewing
Bisect_ppx coverage reports across multiple test runs.
