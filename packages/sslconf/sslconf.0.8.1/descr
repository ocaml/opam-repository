An OCaml version of Openssl's NCONF library

sslconf is a reimplementation of the Openssl NCONF library in OCaml.

NCONF reads Openssl config files. It delivers a data structure and
a query API. Under the data structure are hash tables with strings
and name-value stacks as values. The query API hides details of
implementation.

sslconf has only OCaml code, so it can be used in a unikernel.

sslconf is distributed under the ISC license.
