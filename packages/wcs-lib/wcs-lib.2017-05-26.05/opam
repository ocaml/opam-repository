synopsis: "SDK for Watson Conversation Service"
description: """
wcs-ocaml is a source development kit in OCaml and command line
interface for [Watson Conversation Service
(WCS)](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/conversation/). It allows
to program chat bots in OCaml.

* `wcs-lib` provides a framework to write WCS programs, called
  workspaces. It also offers an OCaml binding to the
  [service API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation/api/v1/)
  and a generic client application."""
