synopsis: "Scalable LRU caches"
description: """
lru provides LRU caches for OCaml. These are size-bounded finite maps that
remove the least-recently-used (LRU) bindings to maintain their size constraint.

The library has two implementations: one is functional, the other imperative.

lru is distributed under the ISC license."""
