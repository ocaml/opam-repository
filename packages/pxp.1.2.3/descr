Polymorphic XML Parser
PXP is an XML parser for OCaml. It represents the parsed document
either as tree or as stream of events. In tree mode, it is possible to
validate the XML document against a DTD.

The acronym PXP means Polymorphic XML Parser. This name reflects the
ability to create XML trees with polymorphic type parameters.
