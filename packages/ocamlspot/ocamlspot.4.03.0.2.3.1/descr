OCamlSpotter - OCaml source browsing
OCamlSpotter is a tool for OCaml source code browsing. 

* You can search the definitions of names of values, functions, data types and modules.
* Emacs and Vim helpers help your browsing via editors.
* Definition search traverses module aliases and functor applications: if module M = N, OCamlSpotter automatically seeks the definition of M.x in N. Very helpful in the modern OCaml programming with lots of modules.

OCamlSpotter uses \*.cmt and \*.cmti files created by OCaml compiler 4.00.0 or newer with -bin-annot option.

In OPAM, ocamlspot.el and ocamlspot.vim is %{lib%}/ocamlspot .
