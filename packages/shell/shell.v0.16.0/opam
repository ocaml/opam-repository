synopsis: "Yet another implementation of fork&exec and related functionality"
description: "
This library is a relatively featureful and flexible implementation of fork&exec with related functionality, including some basic support for asynchronous I/O. This is an old and unmaintained code. New users are advised to try using [Async.Process] for certain use cases and [Shexp_process] for certain other use cases.
