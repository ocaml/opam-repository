synopsis:
  "Linear algebra library with static size checking for matrix operations"
description: """
This OCaml-library is a wrapper of Lacaml, a binding of two widely used
linear algebra libraries BLAS and LAPACK for FORTRAN. Sized Linear Algebra
Library (SLAP) guarantees statically (i.e, at compile time) consistency
(with respect to dimensions) of most high-level matrix (and vector)
operations. For example, addition of two- and three-dimensional vectors causes
type error at compile time, and dynamic errors like exceptions do not happen."""
