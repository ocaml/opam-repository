synopsis: "Parse strings of tokens and mixfix operators"
description: """
Pratter allows to transform strings of symbols and mixfix operators to full
binary trees.
Pratter is convenient for parsing languages made of terms with many mixfix
operators with different associativities and precedences such as
arithmetic or Î»-calculi.
In contrast to parser generators, parsing rules can be edited dynamically.
