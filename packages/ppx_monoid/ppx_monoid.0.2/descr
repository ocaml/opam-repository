A syntax extension for easier building of values of monoids.
Assumes the existence of two operations in scope for some type `t`:

    empty : t
    (^^)  : t -> t -> t

`ppx-monoid`, triggered by the PPX extension `monoid`, reinterprets
the semicolon `;` to mean the monoid operation `^^` and the unit
expression `()` to mean `empty`.
