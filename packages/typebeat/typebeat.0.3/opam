synopsis: "Agnostic parser of the `Content-Type` in OCaml"
description: """
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mirage/typebeat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mirage/typebeat)

TypeBeat is a pure implementation of the parsing of the `Content-Type`'s value
(see [RFC822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822) and
[RFC2045](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045)). The reason of this *light*
library is to compute a complex rule. Indeed, it's __hard__ to parse the value
of the `Content-Type`, believe me.

So it's a common library if you want to know the value of the `Content-Type` and
don't worry, we respect the standard. We saved
the [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)
database too."""
