Library to reuse Cairo-based drawing code in web browsers

JsOfOCairo is an OCaml (4.02.2+) library to reuse Cairo-based drawing code in web browsers.
It's an adapter, implementing (a reasonable subset of) the interface of `Cairo OCaml <https://github.com/Chris00/ocaml-cairo/>`_
targeting HTML5 canvas elements as exposed to OCaml by `js_of_ocaml <https://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/>`_.
