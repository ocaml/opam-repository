Formal proof management system
Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides a formal language
to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms and theorems
together with an environment for semi-interactive development of
machine-checked proofs. Typical applications include the formalization
of programming languages semantics (e.g. the CompCert compiler
certification project or Java Card EAL7 certification in industrial
context), the formalization of mathematics (e.g. the full
formalization of the 4 color theorem or constructive mathematics at
Nijmegen) and teaching.
