description: """
The Coq proof assistant provides a formal language to write
mathematical definitions, executable algorithms, and theorems, together
with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked
proofs. Typical applications include the certification of properties of programming
languages (e.g., the CompCert compiler certification project and the
Bedrock verified low-level programming library), the formalization of
mathematics (e.g., the full formalization of the Feit-Thompson theorem
and homotopy type theory) and teaching.
