synopsis: "VSA-based CFG edge reconstruction made in bap ecosystem"
description: """
This plugin is intended to utilize the results of value-set analysis to complete
a program's CFG by replacing indirect jumps with direct ones where possible.
It does this by replacing each indirect jump with a sequence of conditional direct
jumps when the possible targets can be reduced to a sufficiently small number.
