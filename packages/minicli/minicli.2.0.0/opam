synopsis: "Minimalist library for command line parsing."
description: """
minicli provides the CLI module.
It allows programmers to quickly and correctly handle options passed via
the command line to their program. minicli is intended at
people who develop software fast but who don't want to break things.
minicli can throw a variety of informative exceptions to the user
when the command line interface is not being used correctly.
The Arg module from the stdlib is another, bigger alternative.
Another more complete alternative is the cmdliner library."""
