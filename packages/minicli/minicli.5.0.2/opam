synopsis: "Minimalist library for command line parsing"
description: """
minicli provides the CLI module.
It allows programmers to quickly and correctly handle options passed via
the command line to their program. minicli is intended at
people who develop software fast, but who don't want to break things.
minicli can throw a variety of informative exceptions to the end user,
when the command line interface is not being used properly.
So that, the end user has a good chance to correct himself before calling
the software support team.
Another design goal of minicli is to make command-line scientific programs
harder to use incorrectly.
