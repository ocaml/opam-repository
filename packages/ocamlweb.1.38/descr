A literate programming tool for OCaml
Literate programming has been introduced by D. E. Knuth in 1984. The
main idea is to put the code and its documentation in the same file
and to produce from it a document which is readable by a human, and
not only by a machine. Although ocamlweb borrows a lot of ideas from
Knuthâ€™s original tool (called WEB), there are big differences between
them. First, WEB allows you to present the pieces of your code in any
order, and this is quite useful when using poorly structured
languages, like Pascal or C. But Objective Caml is already highly
structured, and this is no more useful. Moreover, WEB requires the use
of a tool to produce the code from the WEB file, which greatly
complicates the use of your favorite source-based tools (dependencies
generator, debugger, emacs mode, etc.). When using ocamlweb, the
documentation is inserted in the code as comments (in the Caml sense),
and your code is not linked to the existence of ocamlweb in any way.
