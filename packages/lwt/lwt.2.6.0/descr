Cooperative threads and I/O in monadic style

Lwt provides typed, composable cooperative threads. These make it easy to run
normally-blocking I/O operations concurrently in a single process. Also, in many
cases, Lwt threads can interact without the need for locks or other
synchronization primitives.
