description: """\
TCalc implements a minimal desktop calculator that in addition to
  floating point numbers recognises durations in hh:min:sec format and
  converts them to seconds. This can simplify time-based calculations.
  This command-line application provides command-line editing and
  history. Command math functions line sin or exp are available."""
