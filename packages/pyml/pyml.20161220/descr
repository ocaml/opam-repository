``py.ml``: OCaml bindings for Python
====================================

``py.ml`` provides OCaml bindings for ``Python 2`` and ``Python
3``. This library subsumes the ``pycaml`` library, which is no longer
actively maintained.

The Python library is linked at runtime and the same executable can be
run in a Python 2 or a Python 3 environment. ``py.ml`` does not
require any Python library at compile time, nor any other
dependency.

Bindings are split in three modules:

- ``Py`` provides the initialization functions and some high-level
  bindings, with error handling and naming conventions closer to OCaml
  usages.

- ``Pycaml`` provides a signature close to the old ``Pycaml``
  module, so as to ease migration.

- ``Pywrappers`` provides low-level bindings, which follow closely the
  conventions of the C bindings for Python. Submodules
  ``Pywrappers.Python2`` and ``Pywrappers.Python3`` contain version-specific
  bindings.
