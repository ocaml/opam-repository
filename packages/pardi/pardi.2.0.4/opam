synopsis: "Parallel and distributed execution of command lines, pardi!"
description: """
Almost like GNU parallel; just better.

Pardi pushes further the point at which you have to use a supercomputer.
Alternatively, it can be used on a supercomputer to make life in there
much more fun and productive.

Put back the fun into computing: use pardi!
