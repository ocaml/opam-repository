Weberizer is a simple templating engine for OCaml
It compiles the template to an OCaml module, providing an easy way to
set the variables and render the template. String values are
automatically escaped according to the context of the template in
which they appear. You can add you own functions to the generated
module — for example to set several related variables at once (you can
also hide those variables from the interface if desired).

This approach will enable to easily add some security features if
desired — like forcing several variables to be set before the template
can be rendered.
