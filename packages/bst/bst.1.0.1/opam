description: """
A bisector tree allows to do fast but exact nearest neighbor searches
in any space provided that you have a metric (function) to measure the
distance between any two points in that space.
Cf. this article for details:
"A Data Structure and an Algorithm for the Nearest Point Problem";
Iraj Kalaranti and Gerard McDonald.
