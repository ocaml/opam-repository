Bisector tree implementation in OCaml.

A bisector tree allows to do fast but exact nearest neighbor searches
in any space provided that you can measure the
distance between any two points in that space.
A bisector tree also allows fast neighbor searches (finding all points
within a given tolerance from your query point).
