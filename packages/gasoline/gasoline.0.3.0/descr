Unix-ish application development framework
The Gasoline project aims at implementing a Unix-ish application
development framework for OCaml. The framework will provide
application templates factoring application components bootstrapping,
configuration analyse and offering homogeneous diagnostic facilities.

Users of Gasoline should be enabled to:

- Rapidly develop applications by using application patterns such as
  “Unix filter”, “tabular data processor” or “compiler”.
- Write large software suites whose elements offer homogeneous interfaces.
- Use standardised diagnostic facilities supporting internationalisation.
- Cleanly distinguish between application components and lower-level
  software engineering artifacts.
- Easily bootstrap and shutdown applications consisting of many modules.
- Use common file formats such as CSV or JSON in their applications.
