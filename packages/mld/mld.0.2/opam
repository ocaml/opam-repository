synopsis: "The MLD package makes directory foo.mld turn into module Foo"
description: """
The contents of module `Foo` are the modules that can be "found" in directory `foo.mld` and recursively in its subdirectories,
down to other directories of the form `bar.mld`:
`Bar` will be a submodule of `Foo`, and the recursive search for `Foo`'s modules stops there.
The contents of `bar.mld` will then be used to determine the submodules of `Foo.Bar`.
Hence, the following source tree

```
-src/
 |-foo.mld/
   |-a/
   | |-bar.mld/
   | | |-b.ml
   | |
   | |-c/
   |   |-d.ml
   |
   |-e.ml
```

will turn into the following module structure

```
-Foo
 |-Bar
 | |-B
 |
 |-D
 |-E
```

In the background:
an mlpack is automatically generated for each directory *.mld, and the `-for-pack` options are automatically generated."""
