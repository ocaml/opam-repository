synopsis:
  "A parametric timed model checker performing synthesis of timing parameters for distributed real-time systems"
description:
  "IMITATOR is a software tool for parametric verification and robustness analysis of real-time systems with parameters. It relies on the formalism of networks of parametric timed automata, augmented with rational-valued global variables, stopwatches, multi-rate clocks, and some other useful features."
