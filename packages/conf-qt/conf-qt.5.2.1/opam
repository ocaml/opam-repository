# It currently doesn't compile on MacOS because I don't know how to get mac-specific build command
# (the syntax similar to depexts seems to be not supported).
# In general, we need to add extra PATH (Mac only) variable in manner like 
#       "$(brew --cellar qt)/$(brew list --versions qt | tr ' ' '\n' | tail -1)/bin"
# to make `qmake` available. But currently I don't know how to express it in opam recipe

  "It's recommended to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH to /usr/local/opt/qt/lib/pkgconfig to enable pkg-config. Also you may need to execute `brew link --force` to symlink everything properly. https://github.com/Kakadu/lablqml/issues/21#issuecomment-319489574 "
