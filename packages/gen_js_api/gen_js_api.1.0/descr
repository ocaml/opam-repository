Easy OCaml bindings for Javascript libraries

gen_js_api aims at simplifying the creation of OCaml bindings for
Javascript libraries.  Authors of bindings write OCaml signatures for
Javascript libraries and the tool generates the actual binding code
with a combination of implicit conventions and explicit annotations.

gen_js_api is to be used with the js_of_ocaml compiler.
