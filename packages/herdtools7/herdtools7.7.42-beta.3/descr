This is herdtools7, a tool suite to test weak memory models.

We provide the following tools:

 - herd7: a generic simulator for weak memory models
 - litmus7: run litmus tests (given as assembler programs for Power, ARM or X86) to test the memory model of the executing machine
 - diy7: produce litmus tests from concise specifications
 - some tools to analyse run logs of both herd and litmus

herdtools7 is the successor of the diy tool suite.
