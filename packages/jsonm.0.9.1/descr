Non-blocking streaming JSON codec
Jsonm is a non-blocking streaming codec to decode and encode the JSON
data format. It can process JSON text without blocking on IO and
without a complete in-memory representation of the data.

The uncut codec also processes whitespace and (non-standard) JSON with
JavaScript comments.
