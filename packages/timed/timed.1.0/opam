synopsis: "Timed references for imperative state"
description: """
Timed references for imperative state. This module provides an alternative
type for references (or mutable cells) supporting undo/redo operations. In
particular, an abstract notion of time is used to capture the state of the
references at any given point, so that it can be restored. Note that usual
reference operations only have a constant time / memory overhead (compared
to those of the standard library).

Moreover, we provide an alternative implementation based on the references
of the standard library (Pervasives module). However, it is less efficient
than the first one.
