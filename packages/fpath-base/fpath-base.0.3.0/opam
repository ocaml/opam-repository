description: """\

[Fpath_base] is an OCaml module designed to be opened to shadow and
further extend the four modules from [fpath-sexplib0]: [Fpath],
[Fsegment], [Absolute_path] and [Relative_path] for a better
compatibility with [base].

The extended modules export [hashable] and [comparable] interfaces,
making them compatible with [base]-style containers such as [Map],
[Set], [Hashtbl], and [Hash_set].
