CSV Type Provider for OCaml
An implementation of a type provider for working with CSV files,
targetting OCaml. Uses a simple interface generated by a PPX
extension point to dynamically adapt the interface to any format
of CSV files at compile-time, enabling the use of CSV handling-code
without the need for extra boilerplate every time.
