synopsis: "Edwards Curves X25519 and X448 from RFC 7748"
description: """
This library implements the ECDH functions 'X25519' and 'X448' as specified in
RFC 7748, 'Elliptic curves for security'. In the spirit of the original
publications, the public API is kept as simple as possible to make it easy to
use and hard to misuse.

The current version is written in plain OCaml, leveraging Zarith for integer
arithmetic. While this makes the implementation straightforward and easy to
reason about, the performance is nowhere near that of DJB's implementation using
floating point registers (https://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html). """
