Helper library for gathering system configuration

Configurator is a small library that helps writing OCaml scripts that
test features available on the system, in order to generate config.h
files for instance.

Configurator allows one to:
- test if a C program compiles
- query pkg-config
- import #define from OCaml header files
- generate config.h file
