description: """
Dolmen provides parser functorised over a representation of terms and top-level statements,
so that users can instantiates these functors with their own implementation. Dolmen features
incremental parsing, as well as helper functions to locate files based on a language's
specifications (such as TPTP's environment variable)."""
