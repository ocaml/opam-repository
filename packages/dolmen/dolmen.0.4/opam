synopsis: "A parser library that targets languages used in automated theorem provers"
description:
"Dolmen is a parser library. It currently targets languages used in automated theorem provers,
but may be extended ot other domains.

Dolmen provides functors that takes as arguments a representation of terms and statements,
and returns a module that can parse files (or streams of tokens) into the provided representation
of terms or statements. This is meant so that Dolmen can be used as a drop-in replacement of existing
parser, in order to factorize parsers among projects.

Additionally, Dolmen also provides a standard implementation of terms and statements that cna be
used to instantiate its parsers."
