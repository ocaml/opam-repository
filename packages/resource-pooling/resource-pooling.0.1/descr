a derivative of Lwt_pool with extensions

The module Lwt_pool from the lwt package implements resource pooling.
With Resource_pool this package provides a modified version with
additional features. Also there is a module called Server_pool that
manages pools of pools (think about a connection pool to a cluster of
servers).
