synopsis:
  "library for pooling resources like connections, threads, or similar"
description: """
This package is derived from the module Lwt_pool from the lwt package,
which implements resource pooling. With Resource_pool this package
provides a modified version with additional features. Also there is a
module called Server_pool that manages resource clusters, specifically
a cluster of servers each with its own connection pool."""
