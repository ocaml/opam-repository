  "A lua client for interfacing hardcaml to verilator, UHDM, Verible and RTLIL front-ends"
description:
  "Verilator, Surelog and Verible do not generate synthesised Verilog code directly. This software bridges the gap and verifies the results using build-in minisat solver, z3 or external eqy script"

# This option excludes RISCV because there are insufficient regression stations
# to complete in a timely manner and win32 because Z3 apparently does not work
# and flambda because it hangs (or takes a very long time) on my code for the present time.
# uncertain how to detect flambda
