Implements the client side of the WebDAV protocol (RFC 4918)
The file locking part of WebDAV is omitted, though.
The library uses Ocamlnet's [netclient] library for client-side HTTP,
and extends it by providing the required access methods for
WebDAV. Additionally, there is also an implementation for Ocamlnet's
Netfs.stream_fs abstraction modelling a simple file system.
