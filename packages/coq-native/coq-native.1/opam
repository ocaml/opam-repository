synopsis: "Dummy package enabling coq's native-compiler flag"
description: """
This package acts as a package flag for the ambient switch, taken into
account by coq (and possibly any coq library) to enable native_compute
at configure time, triggering the generation of .coq-native/* files.

Library authors relying on the native_compute tactic should ensure all
their coq dependencies have been built with the '-native-compiler yes'
flag (otherwise the runtime overhead it raises removes any benefit for
using native_compute in the first place). This package flag could then
be very handy for them.

REMARKS:
- it is not advised to install this package flag in a flambda switch,
  cf. <https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/11107>
- it is not advised either to install this package flag under macOS,
  cf. <https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/11178>
- for more details, see <https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/12757>.
