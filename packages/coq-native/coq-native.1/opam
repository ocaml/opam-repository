synopsis: "Package flag enabling coq's native-compiler flag"
description: """
This package acts as a package flag for the ambient switch, taken into
account by coq (and possibly any coq library) to enable native_compute
at configure time, triggering the installation of .coq-native/* files
for the coq standard library and subsequent coq libraries.

This implements item 1 of CEP #48 <https://github.com/coq/ceps/pull/48>.

Remarks:

1. you might face with issues installing this package flag under macOS,
   see <https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/11178>.
2. this package is not intended to be used as a dependency of other
   packages (notably as installing or uninstalling this package may
   trigger a rebuild of all coq packages in the ambient switch).
3. the option set by this package will be automatically propagated to
   coqc for coq >= 8.13 (but the packaging of coq libraries for
   earlier versions of coq may need an update: for details, see item 3
   of CEP #48 <https://github.com/coq/ceps/pull/48>).
