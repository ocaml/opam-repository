synopsis:
  "Module to log messages. Aimed at being both powerful and easy to use"
description: """
Logging infrastructure inspired by the Python logging module.
The aim of this module is to provide a quick and easy to use logging
infrastructure.

It has the following features :
   * one line logger creation
   * log messages printf style, or [string] or [string lazy_t]
   * tree logging architecture for light configuration
   * handlers associated to each logger will format, filter and treat the message independantly.
   * use the infrastructure with your own handlers with the [MakeLogging] functor.
   * use tags to add contextual information to log messages"""
