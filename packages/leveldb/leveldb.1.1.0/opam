synopsis: "OCaml bindings for Google's LevelDB library."
description: """
These bindings expose nearly the full LevelDB C++ API, including:

* iterators
* snapshots
* batch updates
* support for custom comparators

Blocking functions release the OCaml runtime system, allowing to:

* run them in parallel with other OCaml code
* perform multiple LevelDB operations in parallel"""
