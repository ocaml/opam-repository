synopsis: "A toolkit for communicating with Emacs"
description: """
Sturgeon implements various tools for manipulating Emacs from OCaml:
- `Sturgeon_sexp` implements the Emacs dialect of S-expressions
- `Sturgeon_session` implements an "session protocol" to make RPC to Emacs from OCaml and vice versa
- `Sturgeon_stui` is a session implementing an [Inuit](https://github.com/let-def/inuit) backend: one can now runs text user-interface on an Emacs buffer
- `Sturgeon_recipes_*` offers different "rendez-vous" points to connect to Emacs

Sturgeon is distributed under the ISC license."""
