A toolkit for communicating with Emacs from OCaml

Sturgeon provides various tool to manipulates Emacs from OCaml.
This is work-in-progress.

Sturgeon_sexp manipulates Emacs flavor of s-expression.

Sturgeon_session is a session-protocol implemented in Emacs and OCaml.  
It enables asynchronous RPC between the two languages and referencing OCaml
(resp. Emacs) closures from Emacs (resp. OCaml), etc.

Sturgeon_stui is an Inuit frontend, turning an Emacs buffer into a UI.

Sturgeon_recipes offers different rendez-vous point to connect Emacs & OCaml:
client (using stdin/stdout) and server (via Unix domain socket), local and
remote (over SSH).
