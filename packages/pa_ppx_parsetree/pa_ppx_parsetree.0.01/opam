synopsis: "A Camlp5-based Quasi-Quotation ppx rewriter for OCaml's AST "
description:
"""
Thsi package provides quasi-quotations (like ppx_metaquot)
for the OCaml AST, so you can write code that computes over
OCaml's AST, using human-readable surface syntax for
patterns and expressions.

It provides them based on the official OCaml parser, but
with anti-quotations at every point in the grammamr where
it's possible to have them.
