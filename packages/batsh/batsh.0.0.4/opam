synopsis:
  "A (C-like syntax) programming language that compiles to Bash and Windows Batch."
description: """
Batsh enables you to write code once runs on all platforms without any additional dependency.

Documentation: https://github.com/BYVoid/Batsh

Online demo: http://batsh.byvoid.com/

* Remove dependency to Core (use Core_kernel instead).
* Rewrite command line front end with Cmdliner.
* Add unit tests for code.
* Stop printing redundant parentheses of arithmetic expressions (bash).
* Not split string comparison expression from if statement (bash).
* Not split list from assignment (winbat).
* Escape caret specially if exclamation mark is observed (winbat)."""
