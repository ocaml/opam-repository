synopsis: "ETH LIBRARY FOR NUMERICAL ANALYSIS"
description: """
ELINA contains optimized implementations of popular numerical abstract
domains such as Polyhedra, Octagon and Zones for static
analysis. ELINA uses improved algorithms, online decomposition as well
as state of the art performance optimizations from linear algebra such
as vectorization, locality of reference, scalar replacement etc. to
significantly improve the performance of static analysis with the
numerical domains."""
