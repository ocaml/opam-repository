synopsis: "[experimental] API for writing dynamic Dune actions"
description: """

This library is experimental. No backwards compatibility is implied.

dune-action-plugin provides an API for writing dynamic Dune actions.
Dynamic dune actions do not need to declare their dependencies
upfront; they are instead discovered automatically during the
execution of the action.
