synopsis:
  "Genspio is a typed EDSL to generate shell scripts and commands from OCaml."
description: """
The idea is to build values of type `Genspio.EDSL.t` with the
combinators in the `Genspio.EDSL` module, and compile them to POSIX
shell scripts (or one-liners) with functions from `Genspio.Compile`.

Genspio's documentation root is at <https://smondet.gitlab.io/genspio-doc/>."""
