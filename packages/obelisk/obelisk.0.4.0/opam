synopsis: "Pretty-printing for Menhir files"
description: """
Obelisk is a simple tool which produces pretty-printed output from a Menhir parser file (.mly).
It is inspired from yacc2latex and is also written in OCaml, but is aimed at supporting features from Menhir instead of only those of ocamlyacc.
