synopsis: "PPX Rewriters for Ocaml, written using Camlp5"
description:
"""
This is a collection of PPX rewriters, re-implementing those based on ppxlib
and other libraries, but instead based on Camlp5.  Included is also a collection
of support libraries for writing new PPX rewriters.  Included are:

pa_assert: ppx_assert
pa_ppx.deriving, pa_ppx.deriving_plugins (enum, eq, fold, iter, make, map, ord, sexp, show, yojson):
  ppx_deriving, plugins, ppx_sexp_conv, ppx_deriving_yojson
pa_ppx.expect_test: ppx_expect_test
pa_ppx.here: ppx_here
pa_ppx.import: ppx_import
pa_ppx.inline_test: ppx_inline_test

pa_ppx.undo_deriving: pa_ppx.deriving expands [@@deriving ...] into code; this rewriter undoes that.
pa_ppx.unmatched_vala: expands to match-cases (support library for camlp5-based PPX rewriters)
pa_ppx.hashrecons: support for writing AST rewriters that automatically fills in hash-consing boilerplate
pa_dock: implements doc-comment extraction for camlp5 preprocessors

Many of the reimplementations in fact offer significant enhanced
function, described in the pa_ppx documentation.  In addition, there
is an extensive test-suite, much of it slightly modified versions of
the tests for the respective PPX rewriters.
