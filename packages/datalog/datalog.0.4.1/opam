description: """
It focuses on big sets of rules with small relations, with frequent updates of
the relations. Therefore, it tries to achieve good behavior in presence of
incremental modifications of the relations. It now features a kind of backward
chaining for semantic attachments. It also features a small relational engine
to query the current set of facts."""
