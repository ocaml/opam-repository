synopsis: "An in-memory datalog implementation for OCaml."
description: """
It features two main algorithm:
- bottom-up focuses on big sets of rules with small relations, with frequent
  updates of the relations. Therefore, it tries to achieve good behavior in
  presence of incremental modifications of the relations.
- top-down resembles prolog (and allows nested subterms). It handles
  stratified negation and only explores the part of the search space that
  is relevant to a given query."""
