A front-end for the C programming language that facilitates program analysis and transformation
CIL is a front-end for the C programming language that facilitates
program analysis and transformation. CIL will parse and typecheck a
program, and compile it into a simplified subset of C. For example, in
CIL all looping constructs are given a single form and expressions
have no side-effects. This reduces the number of cases that must be
considered when manipulating a C program. CIL has been used for a
variety of projects, including CCured, a tool that makes C programs
memory safe.

CIL supports ANSI C as well as most of the extensions of the GNU C and
Microsoft C compilers. A Perl script acts as a drop in replacement for
either gcc or Microsoft's cl, and allows merging of the source files
in your project. Other features include support for control-flow and
points-to analyses.
