The solver for the Touist language

The Touist language is a friendly language for writing propositional
logic and logic on real and integers (SMT). This language aims to
formalize real-life problems (e.g., the sudoku can be solved in a few
lines). Touist embeds the minisat solver (for propositional logic) and
(coming soon) the SMT2 solver. It can also generate the DIMACS, SMT2
and latex formats from you touist file.
