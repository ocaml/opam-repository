synopsis: "The solver for the Touist language"
description: """
The Touist language is a friendly language for writing propositional
logic and logic on real and integers (SMT). This language aims to
formalize real-life problems (e.g., the sudoku can be solved in a few
lines). Touist embeds the minisat solver (for propositional logic) and
the yices2 solver (optional, for SMT logic). It can also generate the
DIMACS, SMT2 and latex formats from you touist file. To use the SMT
solver, install yices2 with

   opam install yices2"""
