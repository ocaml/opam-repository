Abstract Categorial Grammar development toolkit

This toolkit provides a compiler and an interpreter for Abstract Categorial Grammars (ACGs). Grammars can be compiled and then used by the interpreter to parse (if the grammar is at most second-order) or to generate terms. See http://acg.loria.fr for more details and bibliographic references.
