synopsis: "Dice formula library"
description: """
Odds (OCaml Dice Dice Something) allows to write and exvaluate expressions in
the dice algebra[1]. Evaluation can be deterministic (if a PRNG state is
provided).

The companion program `roll` can evaluate dice expressions from the command
line. E.g.,

```
roll 2d10+4
```
