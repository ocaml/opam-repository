opam-version: "2.0"
synopsis: "The Rocq Prover with its prelude"
description: """
The Rocq Prover is an interactive theorem prover, or proof assistant. It provides
a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable
algorithms and theorems together with an environment for
semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs.

Typical applications include the certification of properties of
programming languages (e.g. the CompCert compiler certification
project, or the Bedrock verified low-level programming library), the
formalization of mathematics (e.g. the full formalization of the
Feit-Thompson theorem or homotopy type theory) and teaching.

This package includes the Rocq prelude, that is loaded automatically
by Rocq in every .v file, as well as other modules bound to the
Corelib.* and Ltac2.* namespaces."""
