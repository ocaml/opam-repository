Manipulate context-free grammars
This OCaml-library consists of a set of modules which implement
functions for analyzing and manipulating context-free grammars (CFGs)
in a purely functional way.

The core-module cfg_impl.ml contains a functor which allows the
parameterization of the main transformation functions with arbitrary
grammar entities (terminals, nonterminals, productions). See the
interface in cfg_intf.ml and the BNF-example.

Thus, you may use this module for any kind of symbolic system that is
equivalent to a context-free grammar. This includes, for example,
specifications of algebraic data types, which are isomorphic.
