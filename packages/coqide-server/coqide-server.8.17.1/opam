synopsis: "The Coq Proof Assistant, XML protocol server"
description: """
Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides
a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable
algorithms and theorems together with an environment for
semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs.

This package provides the `coqidetop` language server, an
implementation of Coq's [XML protocol](https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/master/dev/doc/xml-protocol.md)
which allows clients, such as CoqIDE, to interact with Coq in a
structured way."""
