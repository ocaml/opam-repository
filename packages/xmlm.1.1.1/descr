Streaming XML IO for OCaml
Xmlm is an OCaml module for streaming XML IO. It aims at making XML
processing robust and painless. The streaming interface can process
documents without building an in-memory representation. It lets the
programmer translate its data structures to XML documents and
vice-versa. Functions are provided to easily transform arborescent
data structures to/from XML documents.

Xmlm is made of a single independent module and distributed under the
BSD3 license.
