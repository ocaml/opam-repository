Bindings for BLAS/LAPACK (high-performance linear algebra Fortran libraries)
This OCaml-library interfaces two widely used mathematical
FORTRAN-libraries:

- BLAS - Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines
- LAPACK - Linear Algebra PACKage

This allows developers to write high-performance numerical code for
applications that require linear algebra.
