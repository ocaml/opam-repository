synopsis: "GitHub APIv3 OCaml Library"
description: """
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mirage/ocaml-github.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mirage/ocaml-github)
[![docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/doc-online-blue.svg)](https://mirage.github.io/ocaml-github/)

This library provides an OCaml interface to the [GitHub
APIv3](https://developer.github.com/v3/) (JSON). It is compatible with
[MirageOS](https://mirage.io) and also compiles to pure JavaScript via
[js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml).

It is [not yet complete](#api-support-coverage) but
[lib/github.atd](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-github/blob/master/lib/github.atd)
contains the data types that have been bound so far.

There are several tests and examples in
[lib_test](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-github/tree/master/lib_test)
for small bits of
functionality. [jar](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-github/tree/master/jar)
contains utility programs that use the [git jar](#git-jar) facility for
stored tokens.

If you are interested in easily using this library to listen for GitHub
web hook events, you should look at [dsheets/ocaml-github-hooks](https://github.com/dsheets/ocaml-github-hooks)."""
