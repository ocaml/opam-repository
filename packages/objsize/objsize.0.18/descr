Small library to compute sizes of OCaml heap values.
This library computes number of words occupied by heap value, size
of values' headers and maximal depth of values, by recursively scanning
heap blocks constituting the value in question.
It is also possible to calculate the total amount of 
heap memory used by live values reachable from GC roots.
