synopsis: "Async-friendly Redis client"
description: """Async-friendly Redis client

Orewa is a Redis client designed with cooperative multithreading in mind, thus
operations are non-blocking by default.

It also features an OCaml-friendly Redis API wrapping the stringly constructs
of the Redis commands into a more typed and less fragile interface that does
its best to provide a pleasant interface."""
