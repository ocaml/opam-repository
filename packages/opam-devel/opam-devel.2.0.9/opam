The development version of opam has been successfully compiled into %{lib}%/%{name}%. You should not run it from there, please install the binaries to your PATH, e.g. with
    sudo cp %{lib}%/%{name}%/opam /usr/local/bin

If you just want to give it a try without altering your current installation, you could use instead:
    alias opam2="OPAMROOT=~/.opam2 %{lib}%/%{name}%/opam\""""
