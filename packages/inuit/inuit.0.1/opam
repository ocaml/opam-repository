synopsis: "An abstraction for text-oriented UI"
description: """
Inuit is a library making it easy to design simple interactive text
applications.  
This library is only a frontend, managing state and processing event.
It needs an external backend to do the actual display.  Currently, the only
backend is provided by Sturgeon which display UIs in an emacs buffer."""
