synopsis: "OCaml bindings for FUSE (Filesystem in UserSpacE)"
description: """
This is a binding to FUSE for the OCaml programming language, enabling
you to write multithreaded filesystems in the OCaml language. It has
been designed with simplicity as a goal, as you can see by looking at
example/fusexmp.ml. Efficiency has also been a separate goal. The
Bigarray library is used for read and writes, allowing the library to
do zero-copy in OCaml land."""
