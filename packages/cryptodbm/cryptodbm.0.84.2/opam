synopsis:
  "Encrypted layer over the dbm library: access to serverless, key-value databases with symmetric encryption."
description: """
This library provides an encrypted layer on top of the Dbm and Cryptokit packages. The improvements over Dbm are:
  - A single database file may contain several independent subtables, identified by a name (a string).
  - Each subtable can be signed and encrypted individually, or encrypted using a common password.
  - The whole file can be signed.
  - Obfuscating data is -optionally- appended to keys, data, and to the whole table, so that two databases with
    the same content look significantly different, once encrypted.
  - Encryption is symmetric: encryption and decryption both use the same password.
  - Signature is symmetric: signing and verifying the signature both use the same signword."""
