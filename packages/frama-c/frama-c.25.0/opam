opam-version: "2.0"
synopsis: "Platform dedicated to the analysis of source code written in C"
description:"""
Frama-C gathers several analysis techniques in a single collaborative
framework, based on analyzers (called "plug-ins") that can build upon the
results computed by other analyzers in the framework.
Thanks to this approach, Frama-C provides sophisticated tools, including:
- an analyzer based on abstract interpretation (Eva plug-in);
- a program proof framework based on weakest precondition calculus (WP plug-in);
- a program slicer (Slicing plug-in);
- a tool for verification of temporal (LTL) properties (Aoraï plug-in);
- a runtime verification tool (E-ACSL plug-in);
- several tools for code base exploration and dependency analysis
  (plug-ins From, Impact, Metrics, Occurrence, Scope, etc.).
These plug-ins communicate between each other via the Frama-C API
and via ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) properties.
