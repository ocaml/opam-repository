synopsis: "DHCP server"
description: """
Charrua-server consists of a single `Dhcp_server` module used for constructing DHCP
servers.

[dhcp](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/tree/master/applications/dhcp)
is a Mirage DHCP unikernel server based on charrua, included as a part of the MirageOS unikernel example and starting-point repository.

#### Features

* `Dhcp_server` supports a stripped down ISC dhcpd.conf, so you can probably just
  use your old `dhcpd.conf`. It also supports manual configuration building in
  OCaml.
* Logic/sequencing is agnostic of IO and platform, so it can run on Unix as a
  process, as a Mirage unikernel or anything else.
* All DHCP options are supported at the time of this writing.
* Code is purely applicative.
* It's in OCaml, so it's pretty cool.

The name `charrua` is a reference to the, now extinct, semi-nomadic people of
southern South America.
