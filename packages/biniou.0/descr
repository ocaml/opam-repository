Binary data format designed for speed, safety, ease of use and backward compatibility as protocols evolve
Biniou (pronounced "be new") is a binary data format designed for
speed, safety, ease of use and backward compatibility as protocols
evolve. Biniou is vastly equivalent to JSON in terms of functionality
but allows implementations several times faster (4 times faster than
yojson), with 25-35% space savings.

Biniou data can be decoded into human-readable form without knowledge
of type definitions except for field and variant names which are
represented by 31-bit hashes. A program named bdump is provided for
routine visualization of biniou data files.

The program atdgen can be used to derive OCaml-Biniou serializers and
deserializers from type definitions.
