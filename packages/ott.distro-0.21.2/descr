From a definition of a language syntax and semantics, generates LaTeX, and Coq, HOL, and Isabelle versions of the definition
Ott is a tool for writing definitions of programming languages and
calculi. It takes as input a definition of a language syntax and
semantics, in a concise and readable ASCII notation that is close to
what one would write in informal mathematics. It generates LaTeX to
build a typeset version of the definition, and Coq, HOL, and Isabelle
versions of the definition. Additionally, it can be run as a filter,
taking a LaTeX/Coq/Isabelle/HOL source file with embedded (symbolic)
terms of the defined language, parsing them and replacing them by
target-system terms. For a simple example, here is an Ott source file
for an untyped call-by-value lambda calculus (test10.ott), and the
generated LaTeX (compiled to pdf) and (compiled to ps), Coq, Isabelle,
and HOL definitions.
