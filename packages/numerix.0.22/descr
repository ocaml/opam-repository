Big integer library, written by Michel Quercia. Compares well to GMP.

Numerix is a library implementing arbitrary long signed integers and
the usual arithmetic operations between those numbers. It primarily
targets ocaml, but is also available with reduced functionalities for
the Camllight, C and Pascal languages on 32 or 64 bit Unix-type computers.

Note: this opam package only builds the ocaml version (all modules,
e.g. slong, dlong, clong, gmp and big), with the --enable-sse2 flag.
Because of gmp, you need gmp headers (aptitude install libgmp-dev on
debian). The --enable-longlong flag is not uses (gives some troubles
on x86-64 architecture).
