synopsis: "Model finder for geometric theories using the chase"
description: """
Chase is a model finder for first order logic with equality.  It finds
minimal models of a theory expressed in geometric form, where
functions in models may be partial.  A formula is in geometric form if
it is a sentence consisting of a single implication, the antecedent is
a conjunction of atomic formulas, and the consequent is a disjunction.
Each disjunct is a possibly existentially quantified conjunction of
atomic formulas.  A function is partial if it is defined only on a
proper subset of its domain.
