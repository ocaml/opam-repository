synopsis: "Terminal manipulation library for OCaml"
description: """
Lambda-term is a cross-platform library for manipulating the terminal.
It provides an abstraction for keys, mouse events, colors, as well as
a set of widgets to write curses-like applications.

The main objective of lambda-term is to provide a higher level
functional interface to terminal manipulation than, for example,
ncurses, by providing a native OCaml interface instead of bindings to
a C library.

Lambda-term integrates with zed to provide text edition facilities in
console applications."""
