Path-based dispatching for client- and server-side applications.
Dispatch provides a basic mechanism for dispatching a request to a
handler based on hierarchical path names conventionally found in URIs.
It can be used both for dispatching requests in a server, as well as
handing changes to hierarchical fragments in a client-side
application.
