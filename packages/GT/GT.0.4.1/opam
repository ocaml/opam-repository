synopsis: "Generic programming with extensible transformations"
description: """
Yet another library for generic programming. Provides syntax extensions
both for camlp5 and PPX which allow decoration of type declarations with
following compile-time code generation. Provides the way for creating
plugins (compiled separately from the library) for enchancing supported
type transformations.

Strongly remids the `visitors` library from FranÃ§ois Pottier.
During desing of a library of these kind there many possible
design decision and in many cases we decided to implement
the decision opposite to the one used in `visitors`.
