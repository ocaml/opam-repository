A static web site generator, able to handle blog posts as well as regular pages.

In one sentence, Stog is a kind of Jekyll in OCaml: It is a
static web site generator, able to handle blog posts as well as
regular pages.

The main differences are:

- It is developped in OCaml and can be extended with OCaml plugins.
- It is based on a xml engine allowing to apply substitutions on some
  tags. Some substitutions are pre-defined, and others can be added by plugins.
- It easily supports multi-language sites.
