description: """
An OCaml interface to the SDL2_image library.

SDL2_image is an image loading library that is used with the SDL2 library,
and almost as portable.
It allows a programmer to use multiple image formats without having to code
all the loading and conversion algorithms themselves. 

SDL2_image homepage:
https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

This version of the bindings is known to work with SDL2_image version
2.0.5
