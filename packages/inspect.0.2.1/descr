Inspect the runtime representation of arbitrary OCaml values.  

Inspect is a small library to inspect arbitrary OCaml values and their
associated object graph by either dumping them as S-expressions (with
sharing and references for recursive values), or by writing output in
the DOT-language which can then be further processed by Graphviz.
