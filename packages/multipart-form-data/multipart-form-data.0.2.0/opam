synopsis:
  "Parser for ocaml [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cryptosense/multipart-form-data.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cryptosense/multipart-form-data)"
description: """
This is a parser for structured form data based on `Lwt_stream` in order to use
it with [cohttp](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp/). You can use it to
send POST parameters.

There are two APIs:

- a high-level one: `parse_stream` and `get_parts`. It works for strings, but
  has some problems with files.
- a low-level one: `parse`. It works for well for both strings and files."""
