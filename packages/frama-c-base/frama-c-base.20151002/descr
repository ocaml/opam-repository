Platform dedicated to the static analysis of source code written in C
Frama-C is a suite of tools dedicated to the analysis of the source
code of software written in C. Magnesium version.

Frama-C gathers several static analysis techniques in a single
collaborative framework. The collaborative approach of Frama-C allows
static analyzers to build upon the results already computed by other
analyzers in the framework. Thanks to this approach, Frama-C provides
sophisticated tools, such as a slicer and dependency analysis.

This package depends on the minimal number of dependencies (look for
frama-c for a more complete set of dependencies).
