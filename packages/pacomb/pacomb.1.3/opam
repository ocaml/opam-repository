synopsis: "Parsing library based on combinators and ppx extension to write languages"
description:
"""
Pacomb is a parsing library that compiles grammars to combinators prior to
parsing together with a PPX extension to write parsers inside OCaml files.

The advantages of Pacomb are

- Grammars as first class values defined in your OCaml files. This is
  an example from the distribution:

(* The three levels of priorities *)
type p = Atom | Prod | Sum
let%parser rec
              (* This includes each priority level in the next one *)
     expr p = Atom < Prod < Sum
            (* all other rule are selected by their priority level *)
            ; (p=Atom) (x::FLOAT)                        => x
            ; (p=Atom) '(' (e::expr Sum) ')'             => e
            ; (p=Prod) (x::expr Prod) '*' (y::expr Atom) => x*.y
            ; (p=Prod) (x::expr Prod) '/' (y::expr Atom) => x/.y
            ; (p=Sum ) (x::expr Sum ) '+' (y::expr Prod) => x+.y
            ; (p=Sum ) (x::expr Sum ) '-' (y::expr Prod) => x-.y

- Good performances:
  - on non ambiguous grammars, 2 to 3 time slower compared to ocamlyacc
  - on ambiguous grammars O(N^3 ln(N)) can be achieved.

- Parsing from left to right (despite the use of combinators) allowing not
  to keep the whole input in memory and allowing to parse streams.

- Dependant sequence allowing for self extensible grammars (like new infix
  with a given priority in a given example).

- Managing of blanks that for instance allows for nested language using
  different kind of comments or blanks.

- Support for cache and merge for ambiguous grammars (to get O(N^3 ln(N)))

- Enough support for utf8 to write parser for a language using utf8.

- Comes with documentation and various examples illustrating most possibilities.

All this makes Pacomb a promising solution to write languages in OCaml.
