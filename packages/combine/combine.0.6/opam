synopsis: "Combine is a library for combinatorics problem solving."
description: """
The Combine library contains four main modules:
  - Dlx: implements Knuth's dancing links
  - Zdd: implements Zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams
  - Emc: a common interface to modules Dlx and Zdd to solve the
         Exact Matrix Cover problem
  - Tiling: converts a 2D tiling problem into an EMC problem"""
