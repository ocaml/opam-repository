synopsis: "OCaml typedefinition to python3 transpiler"
description: """
Pyms is a transpiler. It produces clean and reliable python modules from OCaml type definitions.

More than a transpiler, Pyms is also a language extension built on top of python allowing you to define OCaml-like variants and use them from a classical python source code.
