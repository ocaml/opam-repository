synopsis: "MacOS X `vmnet` NAT networking"
description: """
macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) introduced the somewhat undocumented `vmnet`
framework.  This exposes virtual network interfaces to userland applications.
There are a number of advantages of this over previous implementations:

- Unlike [tuntaposx](http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/), this is builtin
  to MacOS X now and so is easier to package up and distribute for end users.
- `vmnet` uses the XPC sandboxing interfaces and should make it easier to
  drop a hard dependency on running networking applications as `root`.
- Most significantly, `vmnet` optionally supports NATing network traffic to the
  outside world, which was previously unsupported.

These OCaml bindings are constructed against the documentation contained
in the `<vmnet.h>` header file in Yosemite, and may not be correct due to
the lack of any other example code.  However, they do suffice to run
[MirageOS](http://openmirage.org) applications that can connect to the
outside world.

Note the application must be configured to use DHCP: static IPs are not supported.
