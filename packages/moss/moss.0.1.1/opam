synopsis: "A client for the MOSS plagiarism detection service"
description: """
This package provides an OCaml client for the MOSS (Measure Of
Software Similarity) plagiarism detection service.  It is based on the
original submission script.  The MOSS system only runs on Stanford's
servers — you cannot run your own instance — so you need to obtain an
account first.
