On demand error handling layers with Syntatic Sugar for OCaml projects.


OCaml Sugar
===========

Sugar will create a parametric module  following a minimalistic interface for error aware computations.

As everybody gets the same unified monadic interface, you can have expectations when working with different result types. You can use the same type hinting, methods and operators.
