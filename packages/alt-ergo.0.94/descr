Automatic theorem prover dedicated to program verification
Alt-Ergo is an automatic theorem prover dedicated to program
verification. Alt-Ergo is based on CC(X) a congruence closure
algorithm parameterized by an equational theory X. Currently, CC(X)
can be instantiated by the empty equational theory and by the linear
arithmetics. Alt-Ergo contains also a home made SAT-solver and an
instantiation mechanism.

Alt-Ergo is both safe and modular: each box is described by a small
set of inference rules and is implemented as an Ocaml
functor. Moreover, the code is short (7000 lines for the whole program
but just 4500 for the main loop).
