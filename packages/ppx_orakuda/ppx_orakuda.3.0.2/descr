ORakuda, Perlish string literals in OCaml
ORakuda is a small library, PPX extensions which provide a handy way to write OCaml scripts a la
Perl (or other scripting language). It provides syntax like:

* PCRE expression and matching of Perl like syntax {m|...|m}
* Variable and expression references in string {qq|...|qq}
* Sub-shell call by back-quotes {qx|...|qx}
