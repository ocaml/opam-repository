synopsis: "A pure OCaml library to read and write CSV files, LWT version."
description: """
This is a pure OCaml library to read and write CSV files, including
all extensions used by Excel — e.g. quotes, newlines, 8 bit characters
in fields, \\"0 etc. A special representation of rows of CSV files with
a header is provided. The library comes with a handy command line tool
called csvtool for handling CSV files from shell scripts.  This
version can be used with the monadic concurrency library LWT."""
