Ppx for generating serialisation and de-serialisation functions of ocaml types.

Ppx_protocol_conv generates code to serialise and de-serialise
types. The ppx itself does not contain any protocol specific code,
but relies on 'drivers' that defines serialisation and
de-serialisation of basic types and structures.

Pre-defined drivers are available in separate packages:
ppx_protocol_conv_json (Yojson.Safe.json)
ppx_protocol_conv_msgpack (Msgpck.t)(Xml.xml)
ppx_protocol_conv_xml-light (Xml.xml)
ppx_protocol_conv_yaml (Yaml.t)
