synopsis: "Tester testing framework"
description: """
tester is a unit test framework for OCaml. It allows the easy creation of
unit tests for OCaml code. It is somewhat based on [OUnit2], another unit
testing framework for OCaml. However, its output can be customized per
test case, and it is easier to see whether a case has passed or failed.
