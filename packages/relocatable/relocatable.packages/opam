synopsis: "Relocatable packages required"
description: """
This virtual package is used to specify switch and package requirements for
Relocatable packages. A package is Relocatable if all its installed files may be
copied to another switch, rather than requiring the package to be recompiled
for a different switch.

A package which is not Relocatable should include "relocatable" in its conflicts
field.

A switch which should consist only of relocatable packages should include the
"relocatable" package in its switch invariant."""
