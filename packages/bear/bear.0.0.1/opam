synopsis: "Bare essential additions to the stdlib"
description: """
The Bear library is meant to be a very minimal extension to the OCaml
stdlib. The feel of the library is meant to stick closely to the
stdlib. If functionality is available from another minimal library
(ex. Rresult, Sosa) then it should be out of scope for Bear."""
