Extensions to Ocsigen's Eliom.
Litiom aims to complement Eliom, the web programming framework part of the Ocsigen project.
Litiom is basically a repository for modules offering high-level constructs for web programming.
Presently, the library contains only the Litiom_type module, which contains facilities for
improving modularity and abstraction in Eliom applications.
