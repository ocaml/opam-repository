OCaml wrapper to SVM R packages e1071 and svmpath.

Some OCaml functions to drive the RBF and linear SVMs of the R e1071 package
and the linear SVM of the svmpath R package.
The svmpath package allows to efficiently compute the list of cost
values (lambda = 1/C) that need to be tested in order to find the optimal
lambda.
This package really fires up and talks to an R interpreter.
