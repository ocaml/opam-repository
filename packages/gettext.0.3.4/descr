Provides enough service to build a basic internationalized program

Internationalization of a program means that the program have the
possibility to handle different language. Handling different language
means that it can output string which depends on the language of the
user, who will read it. Typically, if a program output "bonjour" for a
french user, and "hello" for an english user, this program is
internationalized.

It is possible to make things very simple ( at least i think so ), for
internationalizing a program. GNU gettext seems a very good
solution. You just need to use a special function to translate
strings, that need to be translated and they are treated
automatically. After having include this function ( in the case of
ocaml-gettext, functions are "s_", "f_","sn_" and "fn_".

For now, ocaml-gettext provides enough service to build a basic
internationalized program. It comes with :

- a pure Ocaml implementation, based on Camomile,
- a binding to GNU gettext library,

ocaml-gettext a tool to extract strings from Ocaml source.
