synopsis: "Pure OCaml implementation of Zlib"
description: """
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oklm-wsh/Decompress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oklm-wsh/Decompress)

Decompress is a pure implementation of `zlib`. The goal is to create an
available package for Mirage OS for `zlib` in OCaml (instead a C code).

We respect the interface of `zlib` and all flush mode is available
(experimental):

- `SYNC_FLUSH`
- `PARTIAL_FLUSH`
- `FULL_FLUSH`

The interface proposed is a non-blocking interface.


Documentation: https://oklm-wsh.github.io/Decompress/api.docdir/


## Installation

Decompress can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install decompress

## Sample programs

Sample program are located in the `bin` directory of the distribution. It can be
built with (dependancy with Unix module, the `cmdliner` package and a C code):

    ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind bin/dpipe.native

Another good example is provided in `bin/easy.ml` with the signature:

```ocaml
val compress   : ?level:int -> string -> string
val uncompress : string -> string
```

And you can compile this program with:

    ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind bin/easy.native

But keep in your mind, it's an easy example and it's not optimized for a
productive environment - so, don't copy/paste and think.

The documentation is
available [online](https://oklm-wsh.github.io/Decompress/api.docdir/) to
understand how to use Decompress.

## Build Requirements

 * OCaml >= 4.02.0
 * `base-bytes` meta-package
 * Bigarray module (provided by the standard library of OCaml)
 * `topkg`, `ocamlfind` and `ocamlbuild` to build the project

If you want to compile the test program, you need:

 * `camlzip` to compare `decompress` with `zlib`
 * `re`
 * `alcotest`"""
