synopsis: "Wrapper on top of libsvm-tools"
description: """
Svmwrap can be used to train/test regressors using libsvm-tools.

(Scary) usage:
usage: ./svmwrap
  -i <filename>: training set or DB to screen
  --feats <int>: number of features
  [-o <filename>]: predictions output file
  [-np <int>]: ncores
  [--kernel <string>] choose kernel type {Lin|RBF|Sig|Pol}
  [-c <float>]: fix C
  [-e <float>]: epsilon in the loss function of epsilon-SVR;
  (0 <= epsilon <= max_i(|y_i|))
  [--nlopt <int>]: use NLopt with MAX_ITER (global optim.)
  instead of grid-search (recommended: MAX_ITER >= 100)
  [-g <float>]: fix gamma (for RBF and Sig kernels)
  [-r <float>]: fix r for the Sig kernel
  [--iwn]: turn ON instance-wise-normalization
  [--scale]: turn ON [0:1] scaling (NOT PRODUCTION READY)
  [--no-plot]: no gnuplot
  [{-n|--NxCV} <int>]: folds of cross validation
  [-q]: quiet
  [-v|--verbose]: equivalent to not specifying -q
  [--seed <int>]: fix random seed
  [-p <float>]: training set portion (in [0.0:1.0])
  [--pairs]: read from .AP files (atom pairs; will offset feat. indexes by 1)
  [--train <train.liblin>]: training set (overrides -p)
  [--valid <valid.liblin>]: validation set (overrides -p)
  [--test <test.liblin>]: test set (overrides -p)
  [{-l|--load} <filename>]: prod. mode; use trained models
  [{-s|--save} <filename>]: train. mode; save trained models
  [-f]: force overwriting existing model file
  [--scan-c]: scan for best C
  [--scan-e <int>]: epsilon scan #steps for SVR
  [--scan-g]: scan for best gamma
  [--regr]: regression (SVR); also, implied by -e and --scan-e
  [--e-range <float>:<int>:<float>]: specific range for e
  (semantic=start:nsteps:stop)
  [--c-range <float,float,...>] explicit scan range for C 
  (example='0.01,0.02,0.03')
  [--g-range <float,float,...>] explicit range for gamma 
  (example='0.01,0.02,0.03')
  [--r-range <float,float,...>] explicit range for r 
  (example='0.01,0.02,0.03')
