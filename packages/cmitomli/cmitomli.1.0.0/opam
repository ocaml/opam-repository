  "Converts compiled interface files (.cmi) into source interface files (.mli)"
description: """
cmitomli is useful when a complex implementation (.ml) already exists
and one wants to create an explicit module interface for it (.mli).
The effect is similar to running 'ocamlc -i' on an ml file but it
doesn't require any other argument than the input cmi file."""
