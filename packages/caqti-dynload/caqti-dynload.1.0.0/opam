synopsis: "Dynamic linking of Caqti drivers using findlib.dynload"
description: """
This library registers a dynamic linker which will be called when
encoutering an unhandled database URI.  It tries to load a findlib package
named "caqti-driver-<scheme>" where "<scheme>" is the scheme of the URI,
which is expected register a driver for the scheme.

This is a separate package to avoid the dependency on the findlib.dynload
for architectures, like MirageOS, where dynamic linking may be unavailable.
The alternative is to link drivers directly into the application.
