BAP Primus Testing and Program Verification module

With Primus Test Framework program analysis could be implemented as a
set of simple tests written in Primus Lisp language. The framework
provides an unified incident reporting facility for generalized
problem reporting. The framework comes with a couple of analysis on
board as a showcase.

Memcheck - a memory checker that detects vioalations of memory
management discipline, such as use-after-free, double free, and
corrupted free.

Check Returned Value - verifies that a program is addressing all
possible outcomes of certain API calls, e.g., checks return values,
error codes, etc.
