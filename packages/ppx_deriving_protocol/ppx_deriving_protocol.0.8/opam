synopsis:
  "Ppx for deriving protocol serialisation and de-serialisation of types"
description: """
The syntax extension generates code to serialise and de-serialise
types.  The ppx itself does not contain any protocol specific code,
but relies on 'drivers' that defines serialization and
de-serialisation of basic types and structures.  The library provides
both a json (Yojson.Safe.json) driver and a xml_light (Xml.xml)
driver."""
