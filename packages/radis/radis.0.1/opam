synopsis: "Radix tree implementation"
description: """
Radis is a little library to provide an implementation of a Radix tree
(specialized with a scalar key - like a string, bigarray or array). This project
is a part of ocaml-git to have a fast access to an immutable store. In this way,
remove operation should be the slowest operation and this data-structure is
focused on lookup operation when the key is specifically a hash (see
[digestif](https://github.com/mirage/digestif)).

The idea behind this library is to provide a fast access to an immutable store
(like git). So, in my mind, if we put a new object in this store, it can not be
deleted. It's why remove operation should be slow - of course, in a git store,
it's possible to delete an useless object (see `git gc`), however this
computation does not appear in this way."""
