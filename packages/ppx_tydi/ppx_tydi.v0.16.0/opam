synopsis: "Let expressions, inferring pattern type from expression."
description: "
Provides a ppx for [let%tydi]: type-directed [let] bindings. In [let%tydi a = b in ...], [a]'s type is inferred from [b] rather than the other way around. This is convenient for record patterns whose fields are not in scope.
