synopsis: "Semantic analysis of binary executables"
description: """

BINSEC aims at developing an open-source platform filling the gap between formal
methods over executable code and binary-level security analyses currently used
in the security industry.

The project targets the following applicative domains:

    vulnerability analyses
    malware comprehension
    code protection
    binary-level verification

BINSEC is developed at CEA List in scientfic collaboration with Verimag and LORIA.

An overview of some BINSEC features can be found in our SSPREW'17 tutorial."""
