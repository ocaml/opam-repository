synopsis: "Library providing functions to parse and print RSS 2.0 files"
description: """
OCaml-RSS is a small OCaml library providing functions to parse and
print RSS 2.0 files. The parser can also parse some RDF files, but
some fields are not taken into account. There is still some work to do
(add missing RSS 2.0 attributes, add convenient functions).

OCaml-RSS was previously part of Cameleon but is now developped
separately and is findlib compatible."""
