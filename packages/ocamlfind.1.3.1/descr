A library manager for OCaml.
Findlib is a library manager for OCaml. It provides a convention how
to store libraries, and a file format ("META") to describe the
properties of libraries. There is also a tool (ocamlfind) for
interpreting the META files, so that it is very easy to use libraries
in programs and scripts.
