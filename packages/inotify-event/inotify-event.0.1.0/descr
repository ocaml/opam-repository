inotify event tools

inotify-event provides sexplib constructors and destructors for
inotify's event type. If cmdliner is installed, inotify-event also
installs the inotify-events tool which can monitor the current working
directory for all or a subset of inotify events and print either
pretty-printed strings or S-expressions to stdout.
