Next generation of the Why software verification platform
Why3 clearly separates the purely logical specification part from
generation of verification conditions for programs. It features a rich
library of proof task transformations that can be chained to produce a
suitable input for a large set of theorem provers, including SMT
solvers, TPTP provers, as well as interactive proof assistants.
