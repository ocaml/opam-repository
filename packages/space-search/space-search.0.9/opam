  "SpaceSearch is a library that turns Coq into a solver-aided host language. Many"
description: """
effective verification tools build on automated solvers. These tools reduce
problems in an application domain (ranging from data-race detection to compiler
optimization validation) to the domain of a highly optimized solver like Z3.
However, this reduction is rarely formally verified in practice, leaving the
end-to-end soundness of the tool in question. SpaceSearch is a library to build
and verify such tools by means of a proof assistant."""
