A pure OCaml PostgreSQL client library

PGX is a pure-OCaml PostgreSQL client library. The following packages support
synchronous or asynchronous implementations:

* `Pgx_lwt` uses the [Lwt](https://ocsigen.org/lwt/) library.

* `Pgx_async` uses the
  [Async](https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/concurrent-programming-with-async.html)
  library.

* `Pgx_unix` uses [Unix
  bindings](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Unix.html). This
  implementation is synchronous.

Important: trying to run multiple queries at the same time will work properly,
but with no performance benefit. The current implementation doesn't send queries
in parallel.

Other targets can be implemented easily. Check out the `IO` signature in
`pgx/src/pgx.mli` and implement that in the desired backend.
