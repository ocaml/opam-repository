synopsis:
  "A tool for creating new OCaml projects with OPAM, Oasis, and Merlin"
description: """
ogen is a command-line program to help generate some of the boilerplate involved
in creating OCaml projects, such as the opam, _oasis, and .merlin files. ogen
features a simple-to-use dialog that allows the user to input specific options for their
repository, as well as a number of additional commands that allow the user to set options
separately."""
