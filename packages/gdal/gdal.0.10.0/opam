synopsis: "GDAL and OGR bindings"
description: """
This library provides access to the GDAL library (http://www.gdal.org/).  It
provides both direct, low-level access to GDAL and OGR library functions as
well as a higher level, more OCaml-like interface.

The API is [viewable here](http://hcarty.github.io/ocaml-gdal/gdal/index.html)."""
