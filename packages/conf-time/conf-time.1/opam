synopsis: "Virtual package relying on the \"time\" command"
description:
  "This package can only install if the \"time\" command is installed on the system.  It does not enforce having the GNU utility: it may find a BSD time command (BSD, OSX) or a Busybox command (Alpine) that have different options. The only common functionality is \"time <command>\"."
