synopsis: "The BAP Microexecution Framework"
description: """
BAP Primus is a Microexecutuin Framework. The Microexecution technique
was pioneered by Patrice Godefroid from Microsoft Research. The idea
is to execute a binary from any point, using random inputs for
undefined values.

The idea of Primus is very similiar. A program is lifted into the
Intermediate Representation, that is interpreted using the Primus
interpreter. The Framework allows users to customize the interpreter
by implementing different machine components."""
