Build GraphQL schemas and execute queries against them

`graphql` is a package for creating GraphQL servers. Current feature set includes:

- Type-safe schema design
- GraphQL parser in pure OCaml using [angstrom](https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom) (April 2016 RFC draft)
- Query execution
- Introspection of schemas
- Arguments for fields
- Allows variables in queries

Use `graphql-lwt` for Lwt support, or `graphql-async` for Async support.
