synopsis: "A uniform formatter for simple languages, as part of the Tree-sitter ecosystem"
description: """
Topiary aims to be a uniform formatter for simple languages, as part of the
Tree-sitter ecosystem. It is named after the art of clipping or trimming trees
into fantastic shapes.

Topiary is designed for formatter authors and formatter users. Authors can
create a formatter for a language without having to write their own formatting
engine or even their own parser. Users benefit from uniform code style and,
potentially, the convenience of using a single formatter tool, across multiple
languages over their codebases, each with comparable styles applied.
