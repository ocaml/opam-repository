[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mirage/ocaml-qcow.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mirage/ocaml-qcow) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/mirage/ocaml-qcow/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/mirage/ocaml-qcow?branch=master)

Please read [the API documentation](https://mirage.github.io/ocaml-qcow/).

Features
--------

- supports `resize`
- exposes sparseness information
- produces files which can be understood by qemu (although not in
  reverse since we don't support many features)

Example
-------

In a top-level like utop:
```ocaml"""
url {
  src: "https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-qcow/archive/v0.10.0.tar.gz"
  checksum: "md5=fce49e5bdf48ee79bc334e41e562d2d1"
}
