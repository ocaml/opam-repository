Non-blocking streaming JSON codec for OCaml

Jsonm is a non-blocking streaming codec to decode and encode the JSON
data format. It can process JSON text without blocking on IO and
without a complete in-memory representation of the data.

The alternative "uncut" codec also processes whitespace and
(non-standard) JSON with JavaScript comments.

Jsonm is made of a single module and depends on [Uutf][uutf]. It is distributed
under the ISC license.
