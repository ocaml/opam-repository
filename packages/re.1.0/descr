RE is a regular expression library for OCaml
The following styles of regular expressions are supported:
- Perl-style regular expressions (module Re_perl);
- Posix extended regular expressions (module Re_posix);
- Emacs-style regular expressions (module Re_emacs);
- Shell-style file globbing (module Re_glob).

It is also possible to build regular expressions by combining simpler
regular expressions (module Re)

The most notable missing features are back-references and
look-ahead/look-behind assertions.
