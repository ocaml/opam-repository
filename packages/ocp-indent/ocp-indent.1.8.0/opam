opam-version: "2.0"
maintainer: "contact@ocamlpro.com"
synopsis: "A simple tool to indent OCaml programs"
description: """
Ocp-indent is based on an approximate, tolerant OCaml parser and a simple stack
machine ; this is much faster and more reliable than using regexps. Presets and
configuration options available, with the possibility to set them project-wide.
Supports most common syntax extensions, and extensible for others.

Includes:
- An indentor program, callable from the command-line or from within editors
- Bindings for popular editors
- A library that can be directly used by editor writers, or just for
  fault-tolerant/approximate parsing.
