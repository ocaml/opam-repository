synopsis:
  "An `.ocamlinit` helper to `#require` packages in an OCaml toplevels"
description: """
`nosetup` helps you to load the dependencies of your project into your toplevel
of choice (OCaml Toplevel as well as UTOP) so you don't have to `#require` your
dependencies yourself. It does so by finding your project metadata (even if you
are in a subdirectory, similar to `git`), parsing it and then using `findlib`
to load it into your toplevel session.

Currently it supports Merlin's `.merlin` files, though there is no limitation
of which files *could* be supported as long as the `findlib` package names can
be parsed."""
