A single-host domain/VM manager for the Xen hypervisor

The xenopsd daemon allows a set of VMs on a single host to be controlled
via a simple API. The API has been tailored to suit the needs of xapi,
which manages clusters of hosts running Xen, but it can also be used
standalone.

This package will install a simulator and optionally the real component,
if the necessary Xen packages are available.
