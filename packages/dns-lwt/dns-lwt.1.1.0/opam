synopsis: "DNS implementation in portable Lwt"
description: """
This is an implementation of the DNS protocol and a client
and server resolver using the portable Lwt concurrency framework.
You can find a Unix version of this library in the `dns-lwt-unix`
opam package, and in theory you could compile this one to JavaScript
as well using js_of_ocaml.
