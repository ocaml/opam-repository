synopsis: "Isomorphism between encoder & decoder"
description: """
Encore is a little library to provide an interface to generate an
[Angstrom](https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom.git)'s decoder and a
internal encoder from a shared description. The goal is specifically for
[ocaml-git](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git.git) to ensure isomorphism when
we decode and encode a Git object - and keep the same hash/identifier."""
