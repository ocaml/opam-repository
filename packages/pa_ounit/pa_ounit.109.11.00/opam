Pa_ounit is a syntax extension that helps writing in-line oUnit. It
takes care of automatically registering the tests and generates
helpfull failure messages with the file and line number.

It allows user to register tests with a new TEST top-level expressions
and automatically collects all the tests in a module (in a function
ounit_tests of type unit -> OUnit.test)."""
