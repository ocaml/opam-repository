# On Debian systems, there is libgccjit0, but not libgccjit0-dev, so we need
# to explicitly match the libgccjit-dev version to the gcc version.
# On MacOS, both cc and gcc bind to the clang compiler, so the gccjit bindings
# might not work out-of-the-box and we use a specific version of gcc below.
