# Unfortunately, we cannot rely on the OS for selecting the right version
# of libgccjit-dev, the generic dev package does not seem to exist on some
# systems. There is libgccjit0, but not libgccjit0-dev (even though there is
# libgccjit-devel on Fedora, libgccjit on NixOS, libgccjit-dev on Alpine).
