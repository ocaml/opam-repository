Amazon S3 compatible server

LibreS3 is a robust Open Source replacement for the Amazon S3 service,
implementing (a subset of) the S3 REST API. It is written in a monadic
style, currently using Lwt and Ocsigenserver as implementations.

Standard S3 client libraries and tools (for example s3cmd,
python-boto, ocaml-aws, etc.) can be used to access it.

It uses Skylable SX as the storage backend, which automatically
provides data deduplication and replication.
