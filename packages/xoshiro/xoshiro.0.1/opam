synopsis: "Xoshiro PRNGs as drop-in replacements for Stdlib.Random"
description: """
This package provides the Xoshiro family of pseudo-random
  number generators for OCaml, with an interface mimmicing that of the standard
  library. The Xoshiro generator are not cryptographically safe, but they
  provide better randomness than the standard library.

  By default, this package comes as C bindings for efficiency. If bindings are
  not welcome (eg. to compile to JS), one may depend on xoshiro.pure instead,
  providing the exact same interface, implemented as pure OCaml."""
