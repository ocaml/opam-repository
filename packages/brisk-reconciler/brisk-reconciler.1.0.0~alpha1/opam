synopsis: "A lightweight library for modeling tree-shaped state with stateful functions"
description: """\
Brisk Reconciler provides an expressive and powerful abstraction for managing **tree-shaped state** using **stateful functions**. This makes it ideal for modeling dynamic structures like the **DOM tree**, **app navigation state**, or even a **rich text document**.

### âœ¨ **Key Features**
- **Tree-shaped state modeling**: Represent and update hierarchical structures efficiently.
- **OutputTree-agnostic hooks**: Support different output representations.
- **UI-oriented, but flexible**: Designed with UIs in mind but applicable to other domains.
