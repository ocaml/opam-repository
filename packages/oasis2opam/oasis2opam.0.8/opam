synopsis: "Tool to convert OASIS metadata to OPAM package descriptions"
description: """
Generate OPAM files from _oasis. Most of the metadata supported by
oasis is translated to OPAM. A simple .install file is written to
preserve Oasis setup.{ml,data,log} in order to be able to use oasis
for removal."""
