synopsis: "A modular standard library focused on data structures."
description: """
Containers is a standard library (BSD license) focused on data structures,
combinators and iterators, without dependencies on unix. Every module is
independent and is prefixed with 'CC' in the global namespace. Some modules
extend the stdlib (e.g. CCList provides safe map/fold_right/append, and
additional functions on lists).

It also features an optional library for dealing with strings, and a `misc`
library full of experimental ideas (not stable, not necessarily usable)."""
