synopsis:
  "A modular extension of the OCaml standard library with a focus on data structures."
description: """
Containers is a standard library (BSD license) focused on data structures,
combinators and iterators, without dependencies on unix. Every module is
independent and is prefixed with 'CC' in the global namespace. Some modules
extend the stdlib (e.g. CCList provides safe map/fold_right/append, and
additional functions on lists).

It also features optional libraries for dealing with strings, helpers for unix,
threads, lwt and a `misc` library full of experimental ideas (not stable, not
necessarily usable)."""
