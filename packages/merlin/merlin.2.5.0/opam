Quick setup for VIM
-------------------
Append this to your .vimrc to add merlin to vim's runtime-path:
  let g:opamshare = substitute(system('opam config var share'),'\\n$','','''')
  execute \"set rtp+=\" . g:opamshare . \"/merlin/vim\"

Also run the following line in vim to index the documentation:
  :execute \"helptags \" . g:opamshare . \"/merlin/vim/doc\"

Quick setup for EMACS
-------------------
Add opam emacs directory to your load-path by appending this to your .emacs:
  ;; Add opam emacs directory to the load-path
  (setq opam-share (substring (shell-command-to-string \"opam config var share 2> /dev/null\") 0 -1))
  (add-to-list 'load-path (concat opam-share \"/emacs/site-lisp\"))
  ;; Load merlin-mode
  (require 'merlin)
  ;; Start merlin on ocaml files
  (add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'merlin-mode t)
  (add-hook 'caml-mode-hook 'merlin-mode t)
