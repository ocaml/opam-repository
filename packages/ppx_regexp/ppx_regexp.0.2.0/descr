Matching Regular Expressions with OCaml Patterns

This syntax extension turns

    match%pcre x with
    | {|re1|} -> e1
    ...
    | {|reN|} -> eN
    | _ -> e0

into suitable invocations to the ocaml-re library.  The patterns are plain
strings of the form accepted by `Re_pcre`, except groups can be bound to
variables using the syntax `(?<var>...)`.  The type of `var` will be
`string` if a match is of the groups is guaranteed given a match of the
whole pattern, and `string option` if the variable is bound to or nested
below an optionally matched group.
