synopsis: "A BAP plugin that removes dead IR code"
description: """
A pass that conservatively removes dead code in the generated IR. The
removed dead code is usually produced by a lifter, though it might be
possible that a binary indeed contains a dead code. The algorithm
doesn't remove variables that are stored in memory, only registers are
considered."""
