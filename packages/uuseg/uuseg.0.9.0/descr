Unicode text segmentation for OCaml

Uuseg is an OCaml library for segmenting Unicode text. It implements
the locale independent [Unicode text segmentation algorithms][1] to
detect grapheme cluster, word and sentence boundaries and the
[Unicode line breaking algorithm][2] to detect line break
opportunities.

The library is independent from any IO mechanism or Unicode text data
structure and it can process text without a complete in-memory
representation.

Uuseg depends on [Uucp](http://erratique.ch/software/uucp) and
optionally on [Uutf](http://erratique.ch/software/uutf) for support on
OCaml UTF-X encoded strings. It is distributed under the BSD3 license.
