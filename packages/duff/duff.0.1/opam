synopsis: "LibXdiff implementation in OCaml"
description: """
Duff is a little library to implement
[libXdiff](http://www.xmailserver.org/xdiff-lib.html) in OCaml. This library is
a part of the [ocaml-git](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git) project. This
code is a translation of `diff-delta.c` available on the git project in OCaml.
So, it respects some git's constraints unlike libXdiff."""
