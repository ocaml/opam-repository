synopsis: "Typed interface for constructing Docker container descriptions"
description: """
[Docker](http://docker.com) is a container manager that can build images
automatically by reading the instructions from a `Dockerfile`. A Dockerfile is
a text document that contains all the commands you would normally execute
manually in order to build a Docker image. By calling `docker build` from your
terminal, you can have Docker build your image step-by-step, executing the
instructions successively.  Read more at <http://docker.com>

This library provides a typed OCaml interface to generating Dockerfiles
programmatically without having to resort to lots of shell scripting and
awk/sed-style assembly.
