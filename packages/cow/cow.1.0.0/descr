XML, JSON, HTML, CSS, and Markdown syntax and libraries

Writing web-applications requires a lot of skills: HTML, CSS, XML,
JSON and Markdown, to name but a few! This library provides OCaml
syntax extensions for these web formats by:

* extending standard OCaml syntax with embedded web DSLs. It has a
  quotation mechanism which parses HTML, CSS or XML to OCaml, and
  also anti-quotations that form a template mechanism.

* using type-driven code generation to generate markup directly from
  OCaml type declarations. It is possible to mix hand-written and
  generated code to deal with special-cases. Most of the work is done
  at pre-processing time, so there is no runtime costs and the generated
  OCaml code can be manually inspected if desired.
