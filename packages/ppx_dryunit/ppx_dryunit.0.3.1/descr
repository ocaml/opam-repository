A detection tool for traditional unit testing in OCaml

Dryunit is a small command line tool and a ppx that detects your unit tests and auto-generate the correspondent bootstrap code on the fly in your build directory. As a result, you get to use plain old OCaml and all the tooling you already use.

*Warning*: the entry point of this project is the package `dryunit`.
