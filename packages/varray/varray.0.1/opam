synopsis: "Resizable arrays with fast insertion/deletion"
description: """

- O(1) constant time for random access `arr.(i)` and updates `arr.(i) <- v`
- O(1) amortized for `push_front` and `pop_front`, `push_back` and `pop_back` to add or remove an element to the start or the end
- O(sqrt N) for `insert_at arr i x` and `delete_at arr i` to insert or delete an element anywhere else

This datastructure was invented by Goodrich and Kloss and is described in their paper "Tiered Vectors: Efficient Dynamic Arrays for Rank-Based Sequences"."""
