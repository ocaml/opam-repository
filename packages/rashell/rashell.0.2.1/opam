synopsis: "A resilient and replicant shell programming library"
description: """
As discussed by Lowell Jay Arthur in “Unix shell programming”
(2nd ed.), the Unix shell is a brillant tool for quickly
designing prototypes.  Unluckily, error management is very
difficult in the shell.  Most interfaces to the Unix shell found in
programming languages share this fragile optimism, which makes
impossible to write maintainable and resilient programs.

Rashell defines primitives which combine ease of use with the ability
to write maintainable and resilient programs leveraging the full power
of Unix.  These primitives implements common patterns to interact with
Unix utilities as subprocesses. These patterns either yield a string
or a stream of lines, which will also adequately report error
conditions on subprocesses.

Rashell is based on the excellent Lwt library and its Lwt_process
module.
