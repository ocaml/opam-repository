Control port remapping for iOS devices

Now you can ssh into your jailbroken iDevice using the CLI, gandalf.
Simple invocation:
sudo `which gandalf` --mappings etc/mapping --daemonize --verbose

where etc/mapping is a file such that # start comments and consists of 
an array of json objects with these fields, note that name can be null 
and is just a nickname for this tunnel, other fields are required.

# This is a comment
[{"udid":"9cdfac9f74c5e18a6eff3611c0927df5cf4f2eca",
  "name":"i11",
  "forwarding": [{"local_port":2000, "device_port":22},
                 {"local_port":3000, "device_port":1122}]}]

See uptime, tunnels and other metadata with:
gandalf --status
Note that with over 13 devices usbmuxd will start to buck 
because of threading issue with libplist.
Use the custom one provided at https://github.com/onlinemediagroup/libplist

The Linux kernel will also have trouble with many USB3.0 devices, ie over 15ish
Fix that issue by turning off USB3.0 support in your BIOS
