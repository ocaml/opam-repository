Talk to jailbroken iDevices over USB with the CLI, gandalf.

Basically this lets you do:

ssh -p <some_port> root@localhost

for an iPhone/iPod/iDevice.

Example usage:

sudo `which gandalf` --mappings etc/mapping --daemonize --verbose

See uptime, tunnels and other metadata with:

gandalf --status
