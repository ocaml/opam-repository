GraphQL syntax extension for Bucklescript/ReasonML

This library lets you construct type-safe and validated queries at compile time,
and generates response validation code for you. If you're writing a Bucklescript
app that talks to a GraphQL server, this library will cut down on the
boilerplate you have to write.
