synopsis: "Formal analysis for the Electrod formal specification language"
description: """
Electrod is a model finder inspired by Kodkod. It takes as input a
model expressed in a mixture of relational first-order logic (RFOL)
over bounded domains and linear temporal logic (LTL) over an unbounded
time horizon.

Then Electrod compiles the model to a problem for a solver (currently
the NuSMV and nuXmv tools) to produce example or counter-example traces.

Electrod is mainly meant to be used as a backend for the Electrum Analyzer.

See the file [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for building and installation instructions.

[Home page](https://forge.onera.fr/projects/electrod)

## External dependencies

As of now, Electrod relies on NuSMV or nuXmv (default), so you must at least
install one of them.

## Running

Electrod is primarily aimed at being called by external, more abstract
tools, such as the [Electrum Analyzer](https://github.com/haslab/Electrum).

However, it can also be run as a standalone tool by calling the
`electrod` program.

Type `electrod --help` to get some help on options.
