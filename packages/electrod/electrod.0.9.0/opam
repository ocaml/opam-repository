synopsis: "Formal analysis for the Electrod formal pivot language"
description: """
Electrod is a model finder inspired by Kodkod. It takes as input a
model expressed in a mixture of relational first-order logic (RFOL)
over bounded domains and linear temporal logic (LTL) over an unbounded
time horizon. Then it compiles the model to a problem for a solver (currently
the NuSMV and nuXmv tools) to produce example or counter-example traces.
Electrod is primarily meant to be used as a backend for the Electrum formal method and tool."""
