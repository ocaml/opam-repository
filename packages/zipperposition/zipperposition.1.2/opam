synopsis:
  "A fully automatic theorem prover for typed first-order and beyond."
description: """
Zipperposition is intended to be a superposition prover for full first
order logic, plus some extensions (datatypes, recursive functions, arithmetic
for integers and rationals, higher-order, induction).
The accent is on flexibility, modularity and simplicity rather than
performance, to allow quick experimenting on automated theorem proving. It
generates TSTP traces or graphviz files for nice graphical display."""
