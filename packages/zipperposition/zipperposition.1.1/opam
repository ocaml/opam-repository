synopsis:
  "A fully automatic theorem prover for typed first-order and beyond."
description: """
Zipperposition is intended to be a superposition prover for full first
order logic, plus some extensions (datatypes, recursive functions, arithmetic).
The accent is on flexibility, modularity and simplicity rather than
performance, to allow quick experimenting on automated theorem proving. It
generates TSTP traces or graphviz files for nice graphical display."""
