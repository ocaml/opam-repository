The scrypt Password-Based Key Derivation Function in pure OCaml

A pure OCaml implementation of scrypt password based key derivation function, as defined in The scrypt Password-Based Key Derivation Function internet draft, including test cases from the RFC. It also includes a pure OCaml implementation of Salsa20 Core functions, both Salsa20/20 Core and the reduced Salsa20/8 Core (required by scrypt) and Salsa20/12 Core functions, including test cases from the spec.
