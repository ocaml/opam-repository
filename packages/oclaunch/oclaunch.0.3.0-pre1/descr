Command-line program allowing you to launch program on a human basis. Don't let a clock plan things!

For example, here is a typical session (you open a terminal emulator between

  You open your first terminal, your chat client is opened,
  On second launch of a terminal, your task list is displayed,
  On third launch, everything has been done. You will not see anything
  more.
