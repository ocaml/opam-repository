synopsis: "Analyzes program dependencies"
description: """
The command outputs program dependencies such as libraries and symbols. The information is collected recursively with various output options, including dependency graph, YAML, JSON, and SEXP.

The information includes the list of imported libraries as well as sets of imported and exported symbols. The information could be collected recursively when the --recursive option is specified. In a recursive mode, the list of paths where to search for libraries could be specified with the --library-path option that accepts a list of paths. It is also possible to use the host ldconfig cache (or specify custom library config) via the ldconfig parameter. Information about each individual dependency is cached, so consecutive calls to bap will reuse the available information and terminate quickly.
