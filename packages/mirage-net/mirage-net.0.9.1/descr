MirageOS TCP/IP networking stack

This is actually a dummy package that selects a concrete implementation that
provides the `mirage-net` ocamlfind package.  The variants available are:

* `mirage-net-direct`: a TCP/IP stack in pure OCaml that works from Ethernet.
* `mirage-net-socket`: a TCP/IP stack that uses the POSIX sockets API.
