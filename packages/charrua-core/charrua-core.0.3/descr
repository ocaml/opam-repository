Charrua DHCP core library.

[charrua-core](http://www.github.com/haesbaert/charrua-core) is an
_ISC-licensed_ DHCP library implementation in ocaml.

It provides basically two modules, a `Dhcp` responsible for parsing and
constructing DHCP messages and a `Dhcp_server` module used for constructing DHCP
servers.

[charrua-unix](http://www.github.com/haesbaert/charrua-unix) is a Unix DHCP
server based on charrua-core.

[mirage](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/tree/master/dhcp) is a Mirage
DHCP unikernel server based on charrua-core.

Features

* Dhcp_server supports a stripped down ISC dhcpd.conf, so you can probably just
  use your old dhcpd.conf, it also supports manual configuration building in
  ocaml.
* Logic/sequencing is agnostic of IO and platform, so it can run on Unix as a
  process, as a Mirage unikernel or anything else.
* Dhcp_wire provides marshalling and unmarshalling utilities for DHCP, it is the
  base for Dhcp_server.
* All DHCP options are supported at the time of this writing.
* Code is purely applicative.
* It's in ocaml, so it's pretty cool.

The name `charrua` is a reference to the, now extinct, semi-nomadic people of
southern South America.

This project became one of the [Mirage Pioneer]
