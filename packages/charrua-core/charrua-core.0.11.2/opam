synopsis: "DHCP wire frame encoder and decoder"
description: """
Charrua-core consists of two modules, a `Dhcp_wire` responsible for parsing and
constructing DHCP messages and a `Dhcp_server` module used for constructing DHCP
servers.

You can browse the API for [charrua-core](http://www.github.com/mirage/charrua-core) at
http://mirage.github.io/charrua-core/api

[dhcp](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/tree/master/applications/dhcp)
is a Mirage DHCP unikernel server based on charrua-core, included as a part of the MirageOS unikernel example and starting-point repository.

#### Features

* `Dhcp_server` supports a stripped down ISC dhcpd.conf, so you can probably just
  use your old `dhcpd.conf`. It also supports manual configuration building in
  OCaml.
* `Dhcp_wire` provides marshalling and unmarshalling utilities for DHCP, it is the
  base for `Dhcp_server`.
* Logic/sequencing is agnostic of IO and platform, so it can run on Unix as a
  process, as a Mirage unikernel or anything else.
* All DHCP options are supported at the time of this writing.
* Code is purely applicative.
* It's in OCaml, so it's pretty cool.

The name `charrua` is a reference to the, now extinct, semi-nomadic people of
southern South America.
