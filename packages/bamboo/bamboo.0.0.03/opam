synopsis: "A compiler targeting Ethereum Virtual Machine"
description: """
Bamboo compiles a simple language to Ethereum Virtual Machine. The
language is designed to keep programmers away from common mistakes. It
features: state transition as recursion with potentially changing
arguments, mandatory reentrance continuation when calling out, no
loops, no assignments except to mappings and partial compliance with
common Ethereum ABI."""
