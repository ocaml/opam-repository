synopsis: "Bamboo: a compiler targeting Ethereum Virtual Machine"
description: """
Bamboo compiles a simple language to Ethereum Virtual Machine.  The language is designed to keep programmers away from common mistakes.  It features:
- state transition as recursion with potentially changing arguments
- mandatory reentrance continuation when calling out
- no loops
- no assignments except to mappings
- partial compliance with common Ethereum ABI."""
