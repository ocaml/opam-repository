synopsis: "A library to build and run distributed scientific workflows"
description: """

bistro is an OCaml library to build and run computations represented
by a collection of interdependent scripts, as is often found in
data analysis (especially computational biology).

Features:
- build complex and composable workflows declaratively
- simple and lightweight wrapping of new components
- resume-on-failure: if something fails, fix it and the workflow will
  restart from where it stopped
- parallel workflow execution
- development-friendly: when a script is modified, bistro
  automatically finds out what needs to be recomputed
- automatic naming of generated files
- static typing: detect file format errors at compile time!

The library provides a datatype to represent scripts (including
metadata and dependencies), an engine to run workflows and a standard
library providing components for popular tools (although mostly
related to computational biology and unix for now).
