synopsis: "Alt-Ergo, an SMT Solver for Software Verification"
description: """
Alt-Ergo is an automatic prover of mathematical formulas used behind software verification tools such as Frama-C, SPARK, Why3, Atelier-B and Caveat.

Since Alt-Ergo 2.0.0, this package provides the binaries (command-line
and GUI), the plugins and the preludes of Alt-Ergo.

Since version 2.2.0, a Alt-Ergo's lib is also built and installed

(below, 'ext' is one of: ae, why, mlw, smt2, psmt2)

Usage of the command-line:

```alt-ergo [options] <file.ext>```

Usage of the GUI:

```altgr-ergo [options] <file.ext>```

Usage of the "old" Tableaux-like SAT solver:

```alt-ergo -sat-solver Tableaux [other-options] <file.ext>```

Usage of the FM-Simplex plugin, an alternative to Fourier-Motzkin algorithm for linear integer arithmetic

```alt-ergo -inequalities-plugin fm-simplex-plugin.cmxs [other-options] <file.ext>```

Usage of the command-line with FPA reasoning:

```alt-ergo -use-fpa -prelude fpa-theory-2017-01-04-16h00.ext [other-options] <file.ext>```

Usage of the library:

See `https://github.com/OCamlPro/alt-ergo/blob/2.2.0/sources/examples/lib_usage.ml`"""
