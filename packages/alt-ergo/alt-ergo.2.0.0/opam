synopsis: "Alt-Ergo, an SMT Solver for Software Verification"
description: """
Alt-Ergo is an automatic prover of mathematical formulas used behind software verification tools such as Frama-C, SPARK, Why3, Atelier-B and Caveat.

Since Alt-Ergo 2.0.0, this package provides the binaries (command-line
and GUI), the plugins and the preludes of Alt-Ergo.

Usage of the command-line:

```alt-ergo [options] <file.why>```

Usage of the GUI:

```altgr-ergo [options] <file.why>```

Usage of the satML plugin; an alternative SAT solver based on miniSAT:

```alt-ergo -sat-plugin satML-plugin.cmxs [other-options] <file.why>```

Usage of the FM-Simplex plugin, an alternative to Fourier-Motzkin algorithm for linear integer arithmetic

```alt-ergo -inequalities-plugin fm-simplex-plugin.cmxs [other-options] <file.why>```

Usage of the command-line with FPA reasoning:

```alt-ergo -use-fpa -prelude fpa-theory-2017-01-04-16h00.why [other-options] <file.why>```"""
