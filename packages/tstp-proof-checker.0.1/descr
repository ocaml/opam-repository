A simple OCaml proof-checker for TSTP cnf/fof derivations.

It calls external provers to check every proof step that is annotated with
`thm` (other handled annotations are `esa`, `cth` and the `file()` sources). It
does not check the reduction to CNF nor the correlation between axioms declared
in the derivation, and actual axioms from a problem file, only the structure of
the proof and the correctness of the proof steps.

The default configuration uses Eprover (http://eprover.org) and
SPASS (http://www.spass-prover.org/) as trusted provers to validate
each deduction step. Both are available under a free license.
