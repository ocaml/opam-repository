OCaml syntax extension for regexps
Mikmatch is an extension of the syntax of the Objective Caml
programming language (OCaml). Its purpose it to make the use of
regular expressions easier and more generally to provide a set of
tools for using OCaml as a powerful scripting language. Mikmatch
believes that regular expressions are just like any other program and
deserve better than a cryptic sequence of symbols placed in a string
of a master program.

Mikmatch currently supports two different libraries that implement
regular expressions: Str which comes with the original distribution of
OCaml and PCRE-OCaml which is an interface to PCRE (Perl Compatible
Regular Expressions) for OCaml. These two flavors will be referred as
Mikmatch_str and Mikmatch_pcre. They share a large number of syntaxic
features, but Mikmatch_pcre provides several macros that cannot be
implemented safely in Mikmatch_str. Therefore, it is recommended to
use Mikmatch_pcre.
