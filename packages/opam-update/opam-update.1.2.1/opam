"IMPORTANT: OPAM %{version}% has been installed to %{root}%, and it will be used by default for ALL switches. To avoid accidentally downgrading, removing the package WON'T revert this.

In case you need to downgrade to %{opam-version}% temporarily, use option --no-self-upgrade. To really uninstall, delete `%{root}%/opam' and `%{root}%/opam.version'.
