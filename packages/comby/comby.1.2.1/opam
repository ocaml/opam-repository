synopsis: "A tool for structural code search and replace that supports ~every language"
description: """
Comby is a tool designed to make it easy to match change syntax for basically
every language. You can think of it like grep/sed, but with added ability to
recognize code blocks, expressions, and strings delimited by parentheses,
braces, quotes, and so on.
