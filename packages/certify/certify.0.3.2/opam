description: """
`certify` is a small selection of useful utilities for manipulating X509 certificates and public keys.  It uses the mirleft organization's x509, tls, and nocrypto libraries.

Three subcommands to `certify` are provided:
* `certify csr`: make a certificate signing request
* `certify selfsign`: make a self-signed certificate
* `certify sign`: sign a certificate
