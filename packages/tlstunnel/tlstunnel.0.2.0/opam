synopsis: "Tunnel -- a TLS reverse proxy"
description: """
Who needs a stunnel if you have a tls tunnel?

`tlstunnel` is picky; it won't accept connections:
- which do not contain the [secure renegotiation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5746) extension
- which speak SSL version 3
- if the given certificate chain is not valid (or contains an X.509 version 1 certificate, or less than 1024 bits RSA public key"""
