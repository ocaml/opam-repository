synopsis: "Text utilities useful in Binary Analysis and Reverse Engineering"
description: """
The library provides several algorithms:

- Detector - that uses a maximum aposteriori likelihood estimator
  (MAP) to detect code that operates with textual data (aka Bayesian
  inference).

- Unscrambler - that is capable of finding all possible words, that
  can be built from a bag of letters in O(1).

- Scanner - a generic algorithm for finding strings of characters (a
  library variant of strings tool)"""
