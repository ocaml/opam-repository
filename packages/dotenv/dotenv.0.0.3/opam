synopsis: "Javascript's dotenv port to OCaml"
description: """
Small lib to allow storing config separate from code.

Dotenv loads variables from a file (named by default `.env`, hence the name) into the application environment. They can be read in `Sys.env`.

This allows for the user to reproduce the deployed environments locally, as if the application was deployed in said environments.

This is a port of JavaScript's Dotenv (https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).
