synopsis: "Macaroons for OCaml"
description: """
This is a minimal reimplementation of libmacaroons
(https://github.com/rescrv/libmacaroons) in OCaml.

It consists of two findlib libraries: `macaroons` and `macaroons.sodium`.  The
first provides a functor over the required cryptographic operations, while the
second uses libsodium for crypto, and is only installed if the OPAM package
`sodium` is installed.

See the paper http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41892.html to learn about
Macaroons."""
