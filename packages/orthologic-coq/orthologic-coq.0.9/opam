synopsis: "A plugin to add orthologic-based tactics to Coq"
description: """
Orthologic-based reasoning is super great. 
This plugin proposes a verified and optimized implementation of orthologic proof search, with memoization and pointer equality.
It also provides an ocaml-based tactic that computes orthologic normal form, and a boolean tautology solver
based on it."""
