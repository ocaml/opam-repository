Community-maintained foundation library
OCaml Batteries included (or simply "Batteries") is a community-driven
effort to standardize on an consistent, documented, and comprehensive
development platform for the OCaml programming language.

Batteries is meant to serve the following purposes:

- define a standard set of libraries which may be expected on every
  compliant installation of OCaml;

- organize these libraries into a hierarchy of modules;

- define a standard set of language extensions (based on CamlP4) which
  may be expected on every compliant installation of OCaml;
