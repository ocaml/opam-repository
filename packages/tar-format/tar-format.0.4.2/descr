A pure OCaml library to read and write tar files

This allows easy processing of tar-formatted data: creating archives,
listing archives and extracting archives. Together with camlzip, it can
directly process compressed .tar.gz archives.

A mirage interface is also provided which exposes a tar-formatted block
device as a read-only key=value store.
