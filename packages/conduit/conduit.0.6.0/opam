synopsis: "Network connection library for TCP and SSL"
description: """
The `conduit` library takes care of establishing and listening for
TCP and SSL/TLS connections for the Lwt and Async libraries.

The reason this library exists is to provide a degree of abstraction
from the precise SSL library used, since there are a variety of ways
to bind to a library (e.g. the C FFI, or the Ctypes library), as well
as well as which library is used (just OpenSSL for now)."""
