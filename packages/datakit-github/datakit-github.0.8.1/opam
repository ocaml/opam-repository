synopsis: "A bi-directional bridge between the GitHub API and Datakit"
description: """
The package provides a bi-directional bridge between the GitHub API
and Datakit, so you can talk to the GitHub API using filesystem and
Git-like commands only. The `datakit-github` programs can start a
webhook server to listen for GitHub events in real time, and project
it into a Git repository. It also monitors that Git repository for
user-provided changes, and translate them into GitHub API calls."""
