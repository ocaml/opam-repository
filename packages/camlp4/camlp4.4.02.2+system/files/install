Please install a system-wide version of camlp4.  This is necessary since you
are using OCaml 4.02.1 and the system compiler switch (which uses your
preexisting installation rather than compile one from scratch).

If you cannot install a system-wide camlp4, then you can still use OCaml
4.02 by switching to a local installation via `opam switch 4.02.1`.

Here are some installation instructions for camlp4 if you obtained OCaml
via the OPAM binary packages:

* Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install camlp4-extra
* RHEL/CentOS/Fedora: sudo yum install ocaml-camlp4
