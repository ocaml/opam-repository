Please install a system-wide version of camlp4.  This is necessary
since you are using the system compiler switch (which uses your
preexisting installation rather than compile one from scratch).

If you cannot install a system-wide camlp4, then you can still use
OCaml by switching to a local installation via `opam switch
<ocaml-version>`. For the list of OCaml versions available simply use
`opam switch`.

Here are some installation instructions for camlp4 if you obtained OCaml
via the OPAM binary packages:

* Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install camlp4-extra
* RHEL/CentOS/Fedora: sudo yum install ocaml-camlp4
