OCaml-indent: OCaml source code indenter
OCaml-indent is an OCaml source code indenter. 

* Lexer based, simple, easy to maintain, robust against P4 extensions.

* It simply indents OCaml source code with a CLI like: ./ocaml-indent foo.ml 

* Editors should communicate with the CLI. An Emacs interface, 
  ocaml-indent.el is currently available.

* Just fixes indentations. No other code beautifier included.

The indentation tries to follow my style as possible. Neither the
official one (does it exists?) or something already available
(i.e. ocaml-mode/tuareg).
