formal specification and oracle-based testing for POSIX file systems

SibylFS is a formal specification in Lem of the POSIX file system API
and its real-world variations as found in Linux, OS X, and FreeBSD. The
specification is executable so that the more than 20,000 test cases do
not require inclusion of expected behavior -- the expectation envelope
can be automatically extracted and checked against a real file system!
SibylFS has found numerous bugs in many different file system, VFS, and
libc configurations.
