Tool which compiles OCaml scripts into native code
ocamlscript compiles scripts, i.e. one-file programs, into
natively-compiled binaries, and executes them.

Basically, a script named alpha is compiled into alpha.exe. If
alpha.exe is more recent than alpha, then alpha.exe is executed
directly, otherwise alpha is recompiled first.

Compilation commands reside in the first section of the script. They
are written in OCaml and consist normally in setting one or two
variables.
