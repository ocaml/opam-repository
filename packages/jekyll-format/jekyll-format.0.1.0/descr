Jekyll post parsing library

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a simple, blog-aware static site
generator that takes a template directory of files and turns them into
a website. This library exists to parse those blog posts and make them
easy to manipulate from OCaml code.

jekyll-format is distributed under the ISC license.
