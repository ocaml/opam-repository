synopsis: "Solo5 core platform libraries for MirageOS"
description: """
This package provides the MirageOS `OS` library for
[Solo5](https://github.com/Solo5/solo5) targets, which handles the main loop
and timers. It also provides the low level C startup code and C stubs required
by the OCaml code.

Currently this package also includes the C stubs used by the Solo5 `console`,
`block` and `net` implementations.

The OCaml runtime and C runtime required to support it are provided separately
by the [ocaml-freestanding](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-solo5) package.
