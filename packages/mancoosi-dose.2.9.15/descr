Dose library (part of Mancoosi tools)
Dose3 is a framework made of several OCaml libraries for managing
distribution packages and their dependencies.

Though not tied to any particular distribution, dose3 constitutes a
pool of libraries which enable analyzing packages coming from various
distributions.

Besides basic functionalities for querying and setting package
properties, dose3 also implements algorithms for solving more complex
problems (monitoring package evolutions, correct and complete
dependency resolution, repository-wide uninstallability checks).
