POSIX message queues
The mqueue library is a small OCaml library providing types and
functions for using POSIX message queues. The types and functions try
to stay close to the C API. This library has been tested on Linux, but
QNX, Solaris etc. should work, too. Mac OS X on the other hand does
NOT provide POSIX message queues (OS X 10.10).
