synopsis: "A parser for Garmin FIT data files"
description:
  "Fit is a library for reading FIT files as they are produced by Garmin and other fitness devices. It comes with a small command-line tool to emit some of that information as JSON, mostly for debugging. Fit is not comprehensive but reads the most important records from a FIT file that contains the actual periodic measurements."
