synopsis: "A parser for Garmin FIT data files"
description: """
Fit is library for reading FIT files as they are produced by Garmin and
other fitness devices. It comes with a small command-line tool to emit
some of that information as JSON, mostly for debugging. Fit is not
comprehensive but reads the most important records from a FIT file that
contains the actual periodic measurements."""
