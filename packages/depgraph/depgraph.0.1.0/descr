dot graphs out of ocamldep output

depgraph will read source ml and mli source files from STDIN and use ocamldep
to construct a dependency graph. It will then output the dependency graph in
the .dot format.

NOTE: This tool doesn't work well in the presence of packs

Example:
$ git ls-files | depgraph -i "test_" > g.dot
