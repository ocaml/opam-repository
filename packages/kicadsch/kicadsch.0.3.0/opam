synopsis: "Schematic plotter"
description: """
PlotKicadsch is a small tool to export Kicad Sch files to SVG pictures. In the future, export to other formats may be available (PDF, PNG).

This package also provides the `plotgitsch` command which allows to visually compare git revisions of schematics:

![Visual diff](docs/svg_diff.png)

For more information type `plotgitsch --help`.

## Objectives

This project is mainly an attempt at using ocaml with functional programing on a pet real-world project.

The quality of the output is not a first requirement (meaning: not supposed to match Kicad one to one), but the accuracy of positioning matters."""
