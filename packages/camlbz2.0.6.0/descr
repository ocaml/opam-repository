Bindings for bzip2
CamlBZ2 provides OCaml bindings for libbz2 (AKA bzip2), a popular
compression library which typically compresses better (i.e., smaller
resulting files) than gzip.

Using CamlBZ2 you can read and write compressed "files", where files
can be anything offering an in_channel/out_channel abstraction (files,
sockets, ...).

Also, with CamlBZ2 you can compress and decompress strings in memory
using the bzip2 compression algorithm.
