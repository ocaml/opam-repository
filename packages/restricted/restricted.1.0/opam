synopsis: "Restrict system operations and filesystem view of your program"
description: """
Try to call it as soon as possible in your program. Actual restricted calls currently implemented for these operating systems:

- OpenBSD

Even if your operating system is not currently actually implemented, you can still call `restricted` to make transparent to your users which priviliges your program needs and your users can test these promises with tools like (pledge on Linux)[https://justine.lol/pledge/]. Enjoy ;)"""
