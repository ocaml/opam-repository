Collect profiling information

This library can be used to trace execution of OCaml/Lwt programs (such as
MirageOS unikernels) at the level of Lwt threads. The traces can be viewed using
JavaScript or GTK viewers provided by mirage-trace-viewer or processed by tools
supporting the Common Trace Format (CTF).
