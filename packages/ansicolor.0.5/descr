Simple ANSI terminal color library
O'Caml ANSIColor has been deprecated as of June 15 2005. Please use
ANSITerminal instead.

O'Caml ANSIColor is an O'Caml library for creating colorful text and
other effects in ANSI-compatible terminals.

The code is staggeringly simple and the interface and implementation
are both very roughly based on Term::ANSIColor.
