Compiler from OCaml bytecode to Javascript
Features:

- The whole language, and most of the standard library are supported.

- The compiler is easy to install: it only depends on Findlib and Lwt.

- The generated code is independant of Eliom and the Ocsigen
server. You can use it with any Web server.

- You can use a standard installation of OCaml to compile your
programs. In particular, you do not have to recompile a library to use
it with Js_of_ocaml. You just have to link your program with a
specific library to interface with the browser APIs.
