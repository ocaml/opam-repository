synopsis: "Backward lists"
description: """
This OCaml package defines backward lists that are isomorphic to lists.
They are useful when one wishes to give a different type to the lists that are semantically in reverse.
In our experience, it is easy to miss List.rev or misuse List.rev_append when both semantically forward and backward lists are present.
With backward lists having a different type, it is impossible to make these mistakes.
