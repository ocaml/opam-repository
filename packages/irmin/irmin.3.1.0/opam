synopsis: """
Irmin, a distributed database that follows the same design principles as Git
"""
description: """
Irmin is a library for persistent stores with built-in snapshot,
branching and reverting mechanisms. It is designed to use a large
variety of backends. Irmin is written in pure OCaml and does not
depend on external C stubs; it aims to run everywhere, from Linux,
to browsers and Xen unikernels.
