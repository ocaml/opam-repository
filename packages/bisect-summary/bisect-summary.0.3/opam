synopsis:
  "bisect-summary - simple analysis of coverage data created by bisect-ppx"
description: """
This tool reads the data produced by bisect-ppx-instrumented code at
runtime and reports the coverate ratio. Unlike bisect-ppx-report, it
doesn't require access to the source code of the instrumented code and
the *.pmx files that bisect-ppx created at instrumentation time."""
