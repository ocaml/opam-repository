POSIX resource operations bindings
This library defines bindings to <sys/resource.h> functions:

- getrlimit, setrlimit: control maximum resource consumption
- getrusage: get information about resource utilisation
- getpriority, setpriority: get or set the nice value

All this are usually controled through shell command like "nice" and "ulimit".
