Xmlm is an OCaml module providing streaming XML input/output
It aims at making XML processing robust and painless.
The streaming interface can process documents without building an
in-memory representation. It lets the programmer translate its data
structures to XML documents and vice-versa. Functions are provided to
easily transform arborescent data structures to/from XML documents.
