Unicode text normalization for OCaml

Uunf is an OCaml library for normalizing Unicode text. It supports all
Unicode [normalization forms][nf]. The library is independent from any
IO mechanism or Unicode text data structure and it can process text
without a complete in-memory representation.

Uunf has no dependency. It may optionally depend on [Uutf][uutf] for
support on OCaml UTF-X encoded strings. It is distributed under the
ISC license.
