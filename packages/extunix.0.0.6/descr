Collection of thin bindings to various low-level system API

Motto: "Be to Unix, what extlib is to stdlib"

 * Implement thin C bindings that directly map to underlying system API.
 * Provide common consistent ocaml interface: naming convention, exceptions.
 * Simple to build - no extra dependencies.
