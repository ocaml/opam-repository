A tool for the analysis of Electrum formal specifications.

Electrum is a formal specification language based upon relational
first-order logic (RFOL) and linear temporal logic (LTL), mainly
inspired by Alloy and TLA+.  Electrum Analyzer is a free-software
prototype for the analysis of Electrum models: as of now, it proceeds
by translation into SMV models processable by NuSMV and nuXmv.
