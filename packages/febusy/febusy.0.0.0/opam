synopsis: "Embedded build system library"
description: """
Febusy is a library which, through a monadic API, allows one to build a
dependency graph between effectful computations while keeping track of
their products, a.k.a. “build artifacts.”

For now, one can run the builds sequentially with the `Febusy.Edsl.Make_unix`
module but the build-artifacts are still properly kept track of between runs
with “state” files.
