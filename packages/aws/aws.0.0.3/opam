synopsis: "AWS client for Amazon Web Services"
description: """
Package to provide OCaml client access to Amazon services : S3, EC2,
SQS, SDB, FPS, IAM, DynamoDb, SES.

Aws depends directly on the following packages:

- netstring - cryptokit - calendar - lwt - xmlm - yojson -  ocsigen

the cohttp driver does not support ssl for now. Some services (e.g.
Ses may no be available when using cohttp)

All of the packages except the [cohttp fork] are available via OPAM."""
