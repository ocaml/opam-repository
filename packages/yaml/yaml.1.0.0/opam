synopsis: "Parse and generate YAML 1.1 files"
description: """
This is an OCaml library to parse and generate the YAML file
format.  It is intended to interoperable with the [Ezjsonm](https://github.com/mirage/ezjsonm)
JSON handling library, if the simple common subset of Yaml 
is used.  Anchors and other advanced Yaml features are not
implemented in the JSON compatibility layer.

The [Yaml module docs](http://anil-code.recoil.org/ocaml-yaml/yaml/Yaml/index.html) are browseable online.
