synopsis:
  "An OCaml interface to the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) and Elementary."
description: """
The Enlightenment Fondation Libraires provide both a semi-traditional toolkit
set in Elementary as well as the object canvas (Evas) and powerful abstracted
objects (Edje) that you can combine, mix and match, even layer on top of each
other with alpha channels and events in-tact. It has 3D transformations for all
objects and more.

https://www.enlightenment.org/

Currently, only the interfacing of Elementary is more or less complete.

This project is still in alpha stage.
