synopsis: "Virtual package for enabling native int63 support in Base"
description: """
`base-native-int63` is just a virtual OPAM package that determines
whether `Int63.t` in the Base library is exposed as a `private int` on
64 bit sytems or as an abstract type whose implementation is chosen at
runtime.

If you install this package, operations on `Base.Int63.t` values will
be faster as the compiler will be able to generate optimized
code. However, you won't be able to use the generated byte-code with
js_of_ocaml."""
