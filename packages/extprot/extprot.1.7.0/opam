synopsis:
  "Extensible binary protocols for cross-language communication and long-term serialization"
description: """
extprot allows you to create compact, efficient, extensible, binary protocols that can
be used for cross-language communication and long-term data serialization.
extprot supports protocols with rich, composable types, whose definition can evolve
while keeping both forward and backward compatibility."""
