synopsis: "Architecture for building OCaml libraries and applications"
description: """
OASIS generates a full configure, build and install system for your
application. It starts with a simple `_oasis` file at the toplevel of
your project and creates everything required.
It uses external tools like OCamlbuild and it can be considered as the
glue between various subsystems that do the job. It should support the
following tools:


* OCamlbuild
* OMake (todo)
* OCamlMakefile (todo),
* ocaml-autoconf (todo)


It also features a do-it-yourself command line invocation and an
internal configure/install scheme. Libraries are managed through
findlib. It has been tested on GNU Linux and Windows.
It also allows to have standard entry points and description. It helps
to integrates your libraries and software with third parties tools
like GODI."""
