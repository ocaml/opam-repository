synopsis: "Tooling for building OCaml libraries and applications"
description: """
OASIS generates a full configure, build and install system for your
application. It starts with a simple `_oasis` file at the toplevel of
your project and creates everything required.

OASIS leverages existing OCaml tooling to perform most of it's work.
In fact, it might be more appropriate to think of it as simply the
glue that binds these other subsystems together and coordinates the
work that they do. It should support the following tools:

* OCamlbuild
* OMake
* OCamlMakefile (todo),
* ocaml-autoconf (todo)

It also features a do-it-yourself command line invocation and an
internal configure/install scheme. Libraries are managed through
findlib. It has been tested on GNU Linux and Windows.

It also allows to have standard entry points and description. It helps
to integrates your libraries and software with third parties tools
like OPAM."""
