synopsis: "Wrapper around liblinear-tools"
description: """
Only L2-regularized logistic regression is supported currently.
When using bagging, each model is trained on balanced bootstraps
from the training set (one bootstrap for the positive class,
one for the negative class).
The size of the bootstrap is the size of the smallest (under-represented)
class.

usage: linwrap
  -i <filename>: training set or DB to screen
  [-o <filename>]: predictions output file
  [-np <int>]: ncores
  [-c <float>]: fix C
  [-w <float>]: fix w1
  [-k <int>]: number of bags for bagging (default=off)
  [-n <int>]: folds of cross validation
  [--seed <int>]: fix random seed
  [-p <float>]: training set portion (in [0.0:1.0])
  [--train <train.liblin>]: training set (overrides -p)
  [--valid <valid.liblin>]: validation set (overrides -p)
  [--test <test.liblin>]: test set (overrides -p)
  [{-l|--load} <filename>]: prod. mode; use trained models
  [{-s|--save} <filename>]: train. mode; save trained models
  [-f]: force overwriting existing model file
  [--scan-c]: scan for best C
  [--scan-w]: scan weight to counter class imbalance
  [--scan-k]: scan number of bags (advice: optim. k rather than w)
