synopsis: "A library to deal with RPCs in OCaml"
description: """
This library uses a camlp4 syntax extension to generate functions to convert
values of a given type to and from their RPC representations. In order to do
so, it is sufficient to add `with rpc` to the corresponding type definition."""
