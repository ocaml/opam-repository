synopsis: "A library to deal with RPCs in OCaml"
description: """
This library provides a PPX and a deprecated camlp4 syntax extension to generate functions
to convert values of a given type to and from their RPC representations. In
order to do so, it is sufficient to add `[@@deriving rpc]` (or `with rpc` in
case of camlp4) to the corresponding type definition."""
