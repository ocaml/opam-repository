Unicode character database decoder for OCaml

Uucd is an OCaml module to decode the data of the [Unicode character 
database][1] from its XML [representation][2]. It provides high-level 
(but not necessarily efficient) access to the data so that efficient 
representations can be extracted.

Uucd is made of a single module, depends on [Xmlm][3] and is distributed
under the BSD3 license.
