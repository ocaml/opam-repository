synopsis: "Shortcuts and helpers for common tasks in OCaml ecosystem"
description: """
If you're doing any modern OCaml then you're doubtlessly annoyed by
the state of libraries and committing to one of the big ones can be
restricting. Podge is a single module containing specialized modules
for their respectives usages for seemingly common tasks.

Podge is especially useful for Hackathons or data exploration in utop
i.e. you just want to do a simple HTTP get/put request or manipulate JSON."""
