synopsis: "Shortcuts and helpers for common tasks in OCaml ecosystem"
description: """
If you're doing any modern OCaml then you're doubtlessly annoyed by
the state of libraries and committing to one of the big ones can be
restricting. Podge is a single module containing specialized modules
for their respectives usages for seemingly common tasks.

Some conveniences with Podge:
1) Web: Simple HTTP get/put requests that return Yojson objects
2) Yojson: Pretty printing, updating keys, and removing key-value pairs
   from Yojson objects
3) Unix: Read output of a process, simple daemonize.
4) Xml: Simple reading of node content given a path.
5) ANSITerminal: Create a colored string for the shell,
   with or without current time.
6) Other modules: Math, Html5, Analyze, Cohttp, Printf, Debugging,
   and List.

Podge is especially useful for Hackathons and prototyping."""
