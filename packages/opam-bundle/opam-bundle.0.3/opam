synopsis: "A tool that creates stand-alone source bundles from opam packages"
description: """
opam-bundle is a command-line tool that, given a selection of packages,
generates a .tar.gz (and optionally a self-extracting) archive containing their
sources, and everything needed to bootstrap and compile them:
- the sources of their dependencies
- the sources of the chosen version of OCaml
- the sources of opam
- a set of scripts to bootstrap, check and install external dependencies,
  compile all the above, install the packages within a sandbox, and optionally
  put wrapper scripts within your PATH

This is expected to be done as normal user, with constrained calls to `sudo`
when needed for depexts and wrappers installation."""
