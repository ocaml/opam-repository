iTeML / qtest : Inline (Unit) Tests for OCaml.

qtest extracts inline unit tests written using a special
syntax in comments. Those tests are then run using the oUnit framework.
The possibilities range from trivial tests -- extremely simple to use --
to sophisticated random generation of test cases.
