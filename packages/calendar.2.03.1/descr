Library for handling dates and times in your program
The Calendar Library (Calendar for short) is an Objective Caml library
for handling dates and times in your program.

Calendar mainly implements 3 datatypes:

Date: year/month/day with support for under-specified dates
"year/month" or "year" only and support for Gregorian and Julian
calendar

Time: hour/minute/second with support for time zones

Calendar: Date + Time

Seconds can be either integers or floats (different implementations
are provided). The library also comes with:

Printers and parsers

Period: an interval between two dates or two times or two calendars
