  "Optimised functions to read and write int16/32/64 from strings and bigarrays, based on new primitives added in version 4.01."
description: """
The library implements two modules:
* [EndianString](https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocplib-endian/blob/master/src/endianString.mli) works directly on strings, and provides submodules BigEndian and LittleEndian, with their unsafe counter-parts;
* [EndianBigstring](https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocplib-endian/blob/master/src/endianBigstring.mli) works on bigstrings (Bigarrays of chars), and provides submodules BigEndian and LittleEndian, with their unsafe counter-parts;"""
