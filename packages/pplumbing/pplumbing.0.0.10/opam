description: """\

[pplumbing] defines a set of utility libraries to use with [pp]. It
is compatible with [logs] and inspired by design choices used by
[dune] for user messages:

- [Pp_tty] extends [pp] to build colored documents in the user's
  terminal using ansi escape codes.

- [Err] is an abstraction to report located errors and warnings to
  the user.

- [Log] is an interface to [logs] using [Pp_tty] rather than [Format].

- [Log_cli] contains functions to work with [Err] on the side of end
  programs (such as a command line tool). It defines command line
  helpers to configure the [Err] library, while taking care of setting
  the [logs] and [fmt] style rendering.

- [Cmdlang_cmdliner_runner] is a library for running command line
  programs specified with [cmdlang] with [cmdliner] as a backend and
  making opinionated choices, assuming your dependencies are using
  [Err].

These libraries are meant to combine nicely into a small ecosystem of
useful helpers to build CLIs in OCaml.
