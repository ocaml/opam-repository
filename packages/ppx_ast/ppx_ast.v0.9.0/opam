synopsis: "OCaml AST used by Jane Street ppx rewriters"
description: """
Ppx_ast selects a specific version of the OCaml Abstract Syntax Tree
from the migrate-parsetree project that is not necessarily the same
one as the one being used by the compiler.

It also snapshots the corresponding parser and pretty-printer from the
OCaml compiler, to create a full frontend independent of the version
of OCaml."""
