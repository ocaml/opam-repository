synopsis: "Streaming ZIP XML XLSX parser"
description: """
SZXX is a streaming and efficient XLSX parser built from the ground up for low and constant memory usage (<10Mb).
SZXX is able to output XLSX rows while reading from a network socket without buffering any part of the file.
It can also stream data out of ZIP and XML files without buffering.

Assumes a 64-bit architecture, large files (>4Gb) may not work on 32-bit systems.
