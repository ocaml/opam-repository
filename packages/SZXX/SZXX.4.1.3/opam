description: """
SZXX is a streaming and efficient XLSX, ZIP and XML parser built from the ground up for low and constant memory usage (<10Mb).
SZXX is able to output XLSX rows while reading from a network socket without buffering any part of the file.
It can also stream data (including network sockets) out of ZIP and XML files without buffering.
