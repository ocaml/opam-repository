synopsis: "Streaming ZIP XML XLSX parser"
description: """
SZXX is a streaming, non-seeking and efficient XLSX parser built from ground up for low memory usage.
SZXX is able to output XLSX rows while a file is being read from the file descriptor without buffering any part of the file.
It can also stream data out of ZIP files and XML files without buffering.
