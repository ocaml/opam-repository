Bindings for Hyper-V AF_VSOCK

[![Build Status (Linux)](https://travis-ci.org/mirage/ocaml-hvsock.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mirage/ocaml-hvsock)
[![Build status (Windows)](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/974tsg317b4k8xra?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mirage/ocaml-hvsock/branch/master)

These bindings allow Host <-> VM communication on Hyper-V systems on both Linux
and Windows.

*Warning*: the `AF_HYPERV` patches for Linux are not yet merged and hence the
definition of `AF_HYPERV` is not yet stable. If other address families are merged
before this one then the value of `AF_HYPERV` will change!

Please read [the API documentation](https://djs55.github.io/ocaml-hvsock/index.html).
