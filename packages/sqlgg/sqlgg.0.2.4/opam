synopsis: "SQL Guided (code) Generator"
description: """
sqlgg is an SQL query parser and binding code generator for C#, C++, Java, OCaml.
Distinguishing feature of sqlgg is that it starts off with actual SQL queries,
not object models or SQL table descriptions. It analyzes SQL query and determines
the set of input parameters and the set of resulting columns. Consequently, the
generated code (in host language) maps query parameters on function arguments
with corresponding native data types.
  The main idea is that the generator should take care only of semantic binding between
SQL and code sides, being as unobtrusive as possible. So the choice of the specific
database and API is a programmer's choice. Similarly, queries to the database are expressed
in plain SQL, so that the generator can be easily plugged in any existing project."""
