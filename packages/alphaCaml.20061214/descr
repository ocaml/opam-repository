Turns a so-called "binding specification" into an OCaml compilation unit
Cαml (pronounced: "alphaCaml") is a tool that turns a so-called
"binding specification" into an OCaml compilation unit. This helps
writers of interpreters, compilers, or other
programs-that-manipulate-programs deal with α-conversion in a safe and
concise style.
