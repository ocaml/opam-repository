synopsis: "Fast MessagePack (http://msgpack.org) library"
description: """
msgpck is written in pure OCaml.

MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you
exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and
smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical
short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings
themselves."""
