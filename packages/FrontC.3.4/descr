Library providing a C parser and lexer
FrontC is an OCAML library providing a C parser and lexer. The result
is a syntactic tree easy to process with usual OCAML tree management.

It provides support for ANSI C syntax, old-C K&R style syntax and the
standard GNU CC attributes.

It provides also a C pretty printer as an example of use.
