synopsis: "Knowledge Representation Library"
description: """
The library provides facilities for storing, accumulating, and
computing knowledge. The knowledge could be represented indirectly,
in the Knowledge Base, or directly as knowledge values. The
library focuses on representing knowledge that is partial and
provides mechanisms for knowledge accumulation and
refinement. The knowledge representation library leverages the
powerful type system of the OCaml language to facilitate
development of complex knowledge representation and reasoning systems.
