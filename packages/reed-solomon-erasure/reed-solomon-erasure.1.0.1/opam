synopsis: "OCaml implementation of Reed-Solomon erasure coding"
description: """
This library provides an encoder/decoder for Reed-Solomon erasure code.

Please note that erasure coding means errors are not directly detected or corrected,
but missing data pieces(shards) can be reconstructed given that
the configuration provides high enough redundancy.

You will have to implement error detection separately(e.g. via checksums)
and simply leave out the corrupted shards when attempting to reconstruct
the missing data."""
