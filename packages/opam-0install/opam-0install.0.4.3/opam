opam-version: "2.0"
synopsis: "Opam solver using 0install backend"
description: """
Opam's default solver is designed to maintain a set of packages
over time, minimising disruption when installing new programs and
finding a compromise solution across all packages.

In many situations (e.g. CI, local roots or duniverse builds) this
is not necessary, and we can get a solution much faster by using
a different algorithm.

This package uses 0install's solver algorithm with opam packages.
