synopsis: "Establish trust in community repositories"
description: """
Conex is a utility for verify and attest release integrity and authenticity of community repositories through the use of cryptographic signatures (RSA-PSS-SHA256). It is based on [the update framework](https://theupdateframework.github.io/), especially on their [CCS 2010 paper](https://isis.poly.edu/~jcappos/papers/samuel_tuf_ccs_2010.pdf), and adapted to the requirements of the [opam](https://ocaml.opam.org) [repository](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository).

The developer sign their release checksums and build instructions.  A quorum (with a configurable threshold) of repository maintainers signs the package name to developer key relation.  These repository maintainers are enrolled by a quorum of offline root keys.

The [TUF spec](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md) has a good overview of attacks and threat model, both of which are shared by conex."""
