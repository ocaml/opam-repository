A library enabling the safe storage of user passwords
OCaml-safepass is a library offering facilities for the safe storage
of user passwords. By "safe" we mean that passwords are salted and
hashed using the Bcrypt algorithm. Salting prevents rainbow-table
based attacks, whereas hashing by a very time-consuming algorithm such
as Bcrypt renders brute-force password cracking impractical.

OCaml-safepass's obvious usage domain are web applications, though it
does not depend on any particular framework. Internally,
OCaml-safepass binds to the C routines from Openwall's
Crypt_blowfish. However, it would be incorrect to describe
OCaml-safepass as an OCaml binding to Crypt_blowfish, because the API
it exposes is higher-level and more compact than that offered by
Crypt_blowfish. Moreover, OCaml-safepass's API takes advantage of
OCaml's type-system to make usage mistakes nearly impossible.

OCaml-safepass is developed by Dario Teixeira and is licensed under
the terms of the GNU LGPL 2.1 with the usual OCaml linking exception.
