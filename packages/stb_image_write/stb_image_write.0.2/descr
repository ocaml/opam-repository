OCaml bindings to stb_image_write, a public domain image writer 

Stb_image_write is an OCaml binding to stb_image_write from Sean Barrett, [Nothings](http://nothings.org/).

  stb_image_write.h writes out PNG/BMP/TGA images to C stdio.

The OCaml binding is released under CC-0 license.  It has no dependency beside
working OCaml and C compilers (stb_image_write is self-contained).
