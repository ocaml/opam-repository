synopsis: "A counter-example finder for higher-order logic."
description: """
Nunchaku is a counter-example finder for higher-order logic, designed to be
used from various proof assistants, and a spiritual successor to Nitpick. It
relies encodings and external solvers (CVC4, kodkod, paradox, smbc) to find
models, thanks to its modular architecture."""
