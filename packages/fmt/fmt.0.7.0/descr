OCaml Format pretty-printer combinators

Fmt exposes combinators to devise `Format` pretty-printing functions.

Fmt depends only on the OCaml standard library. The optional Fmt_tty
library that allows to setup formatters for terminal color output
depends on the Unix library. Fmt is distributed under the BSD3
license.
