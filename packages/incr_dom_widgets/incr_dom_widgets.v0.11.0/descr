A library of libraries and widgets for Incr_dom applications.

For the moment, most of the libraries contained here are about
efficient rendering of tabular data, in particular supporting /partial
rendering/, /i.e./, only rendering a subset of the widgets that are
logically in the view, depending on what is expected to be visible to
the end user.
