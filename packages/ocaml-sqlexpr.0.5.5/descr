Type-safe, convenient SQLite database access.
Minimalistic library and syntax extension for type-safe, convenient
execution of SQL statements. Currently compatible with Sqlite3.

Sqlexpr features:

* automated prepared statement caching, param binding, data
extraction, error checking (including automatic stmt reset to avoid
BUSY/LOCKED errors in subsequent queries), stmt finalization on db
close, etc.

* HOFs like iter, fold, transaction

* support for different concurrency models: everything is functorized
over a THREAD monad, so you can for instance do concurrent folds/iters
with Lwt

* support for SQL stmt syntax checks and some extra semantic checking
(column names, etc)
