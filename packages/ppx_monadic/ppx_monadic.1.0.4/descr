ppx extension for do notation, pattern guards, and monad comprehension 
ppx_monadic
=================================

ppx_monadic is a PPX syntax extension for monadic bind syntactic sugar.

The sugar is supported inside the following constructs:
* `do_` sequence notation for monadic bind
* `when` clause for pattern guards
* `[%comp e || ..]` for list (and other monadic) comprehensions
