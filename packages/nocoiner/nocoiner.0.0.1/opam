synopsis: "A Commitment Scheme library for Coin Flipping/Tossing algorithms and sort"
description: """
This project implements Commitment Schemes using the
Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) of secret-key encryption. Because this AES
encryption mode provides both Message Confidentiality and Integrity, it fits
perfectly the Hiding and Binding properties of Commitment Schemes.
Confidentiality protects the message against passive attacks while integrity
protects it from active attacks. GCM, so, works as an
Authenticated Encryption where it roughly works as an encryption algorithm
with MAC signatures on cipher data.
