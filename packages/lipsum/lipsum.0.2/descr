lipsum - self-contained tool for literate programming in tradition of NoWeb

Lipsum is a command-line utility for literate programming. It stands in the
tradition of [Noweb](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/), a popular and
flexible literate programming system by Norman Ramsey. The idea of literate
programming is to keep documentation for programmers and program code in
one file and to arrange it in a way that helps understanding it best. To
actually compile or run the code it needs to be extracted from the literate
program and Lipsum is a tool to do this.

Like Noweb, Lipsum employs a minimal markup to arrange documentation and
code in a file. Also like Noweb, Lipsum is language agnostic and can be
used for almost any programming language and documentation.
