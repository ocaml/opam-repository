Chemoinformatics software for Ligand-Based Virtual Screening (LBVS) using consensus queries.

Similarity search for molecules using several known active molecules (for your protein of interest) instead of a single query search.
Details can be found in the paper: "Consensus queries in ligand-based virtual
screening experiments". F. Berenger, O. Vu and J., Meiler. Journal of Cheminformatics, November 2017.
