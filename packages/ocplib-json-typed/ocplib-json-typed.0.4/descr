Type-aware JSON and JSON schema utilities

Can be used with any JSON library.

This library currently contains five modules:

- Json_encoding:
    Mappings between OCaml types and JSON structures.
    Encodings are used to produce readers, writers and
    JSON schemas for format documentation and interoperability.
- Json_schema:
    Manual creation and manipulation of JSON schemas.
- Json_query:
    Simple manipulations of JSON documents
    (extraction, injection, merging, etc.).
- Json_repr:
    Modular abstraction over JSON representations.
    Includes Ezjsonm and Yojson representations.
- Json_repr_bson:
    Implementation of the JSON compatible subset
    of BSON, with a Json_repr compatible interface.
- Json_repr_browser:
    Json_repr interface over JavaScript's objects.
    Built only if js_of_ocaml is present.
