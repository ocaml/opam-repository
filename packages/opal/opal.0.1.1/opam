synopsis: "Self-contained monadic parser combinators for OCaml"
description:
  "Opal is a minimum collection of useful parsers and combinators (~150 loc of OCaml) that makes writing parsers easier. It is designed to be small, self-contained, pure-functional, and only includes most essential parsers, so that one could include single file in the project or just embed it in other OCaml source code files."
