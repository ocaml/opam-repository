synopsis: "Convert a filesystem into a static OCaml module"
description: """
`ocaml-crunch` takes a directory of files and compiles them into a standalone
OCaml module which serves the contents directly from memory.  This can be
convenient for libraries that need a few embedded files (such as a web server)
and do not want to deal with all the trouble of file configuration.
