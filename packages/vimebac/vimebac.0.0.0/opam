synopsis:
  "Vimebac is graphical metronome and instructions display that interfaces with"
description: """
JACK-midi applications.  The display can be completely driven by MIDI events and
it can also send MIDI events.

It can also be self-driven and hence run without `jackd` although this is
somewhat less interesting since it becomes *just* a visual metronome.

The current features are:

- A visual metronome with arbitrary time-signatures.
- The display of arbitrary lines of text, e.g. to give instructions to the
  musician(s).
- Custom keyboard bindings to send arbitrary MIDI events."""
