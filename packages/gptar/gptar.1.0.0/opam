synopsis: "GPT headers that are also valid tar headers"
description: """
Marshaling GPT headers such that they are a valid tar archive.
              The archive will contain a dummy file named `GPTAR` whose content
              is (at least) the GPT header and the partition table entries.
              Put a tar-partition at the first available space, and you can
              inspect the tar archive using regular tar utilities on the disk
              image with the caveat of the added `GPTAR` dummy file."""
