synopsis: "Versioned Random module from the OCaml standard library"
description: """
The stdlib-random package provides a stable and compiler-independent
implementation of all the PRNGs used in the Random module.
Those PRNGs are available in the various libraries:
- stdlib-random.v3: OCaml 3.07 to 3.11 PRNG
- stdlib-random.v4: OCaml 3.12 to 4.14 PRNG
- stdlib-random.v5: current OCaml 5.0 PRNG
- stdlib-random.v5o: pure OCaml version of the OCaml 5 PRNG
All those libraries can be used together and the signature of their
Random$n module has been extended to the latest signature whenever possible.
