synopsis: "Turn directories into OCaml modules"
description: """
An Ocamlbuild plugin that turns directories tagged with "namespace" into a
module hierarchy. File names become scoped, so you can have the same filename in
multiple directories. So, if you have

    server
    |-- foo.ml
    +-- bar.ml
    client
    |-- foo.ml
    |-- bar.ml
    |-- ui
    |   +-- reactive.ml
    +-- client.ml

It is as if you had written

    module Server =
    struct
        module Foo = (* server/foo.ml *)
        module Bar = (* server/bar.ml *)
    end

    module Client =
    struct
        module Foo = (* client/foo.ml *)
        module Bar = (* client/bar.ml *)
        module Ui =
        struct
            module Reactive = (* client/ui/reactive.ml *)
        end

        include (* client/client.ml *)
    end"""
