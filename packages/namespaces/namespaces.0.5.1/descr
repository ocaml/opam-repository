Turn directories into OCaml modules

An Ocamlbuild plugin that turns directories tagged with "namespace" into a
nested module hierarchy. Each directory becomes a module. Filenames become
scoped, so you can have the same filename in multiple directories. So, if you
have

    server
    |-- foo.ml
    +-- bar.ml
    client
    |-- foo.ml
    |-- bar.ml
    |-- ui
    |   +-- reactive.ml
    +-- client.ml

It is as if you had written

    module Server =
    struct
        module Foo = (* server/foo.ml *)
        module Bar = (* server/bar.ml *)
    end

    module Client =
    struct
        module Foo = (* client/foo.ml *)
        module Bar = (* client/bar.ml *)
        module Ui =
        struct
            module Reactive = (* client/ui/reactive.ml *)
        end

        include (* client/client.ml *)
    end
