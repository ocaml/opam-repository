A library implementing a simplex algorithm, in a functional style, for solving systems of linear inequalities and optimizing linear objective functions


`ocplib-simplex` is a (fully) functional OCaml implementation of the
simplex algorithm for solving systems of linear inequalities. The
implementation is incremental and backtrackable. It is able to extract
unsat-cores for unsatisfiable problems. Versions `> 0.1` also support
linear optimization.
