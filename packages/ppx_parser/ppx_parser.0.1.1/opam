synopsis: "OCaml PPX extension for writing stream parsers"
description: """

 This library is an OCaml ppx rewriter for writing stream parser. 
 Its notation is close to the notation of Camlp4 stream parsers. 
 Hence, it can be used as a replacement for projects 
 that still rely on the stream parser notation of Camlp4. 
 
 For newer projects, it is advised to use lexer and parser generators.
