description: """
We search for IDA via 'which` utility and in the following locations:
on Linux: in $HOME
on macOS: in /Applications, $HOME/Applications/, $HOME.
up to depth 4, and no more than 1024 entries in total.
The first found entry is used.

A path to ida can be hinted by setting opam config variable:
opam config set ida-path <path-to-ida>

Also can be hinted with IDA_PATH environment variable, e.g.,
IDA_PATH=<path-to-ida> opam install conf-ida
